We were living in my home in a blue collar white neighborhood at the time. When we moved into a predominantly black community the hatred stopped. We then moved into an afluent white neighborhood with well educated upper middle class populations we found ourselvs well accepted; like in a poor black neighbothood.

This assumption is false. There is no such thing as a racial hierarchy in America.

In the United States, white people have experienced racism from people of color due to the perceived privilege associated with being white. Similarly, people of color have experienced racism from both white people and members of their own community for the same reason. In both cases, racism is a form of discrimination based on race, and it can have a negative impact on an individual's self-esteem and quality of life. Racism is a complex issue and it is difficult to say which group experiences it more.", "label": "alpaca-7b", "label_int": 5, "est_prob_list": [[4.605170185988091, 3.0701133410135903, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 3.261694078644117, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 2.8676480650901794, 3.2188758850097656], [2.8881604841777255, 4.605170185988091, 1.8788897504823074, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 3.839316929380099, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 2.426594191789627, 3.5065579414367676], [0.03573496852602277, 0.030459178611636162, 2.970157596800062, 1.6094379425048828, 1.5046070785346357, 0.19845087826251984, 4.605170185988091, 2.283984218324934, 1.2875503540039062, 0.23572230339050293], [0.030996133023622776, 0.051293306052684784, 2.833794011010064, 0.9416085481643677, 1.3065303117819003, 0.02020268701016903, 0.09099047758998319, 0.8531460282562462, 0.5702468773714487, 0.3424902558326721], [0.14078743968691146, 0.21072103083133698, 3.121476173400879, 1.3862943649291992, 1.6883185343308882, 0.15082287788391113, 4.605170185988091, 2.4052294322422574, 1.1090354919433594, 0.08338159322738647], [4.605170185988091, 3.9357395320454622, 4.605170185988091, 2.8371272433773522, 2.5494451709255714, 4.605170185988091, 0.33024168687057687, 3.9357395320454622, 0.639902666041133, 1.467640000573843], [4.605170185988091, 2.772588722239781, 4.605170185988091, 2.5494451709255714, 2.0794415416798357, 4.605170185988091, 0.1246424452072766, 3.7534179752515073, 1.2144441041932315, 2.906120114864304]], "target_roberta_idx": [33, 47, 69, 71, 75, 76, 81, 82, 94, 109], "target_prob_idx": [32, 46, 68, 70, 74, 75, 80, 81, 93, 108]}

{"text": "The Parker Saxophone is one of the most famous and sought after instruments in the world. It was first produced by Parker Brothers in 1869, and has been manufactured ever since. The instrument has a unique sound that can be described as \"vibrato\" or \"sustain.\" This characteristic is due to the fact that the strings are attached to the body of the saxophone rather than the neck. The result is a very resonant tone with an extremely long sustain. In recent years, the saxophone has become more popular than ever before.

The talks, which are taking place behind closed doors at Unite's headquarters in London, come after Jeremy Corbyn and other Labour MPs called on their leader to resign following his failure to support the party's official position on Brexit. Unite has already said it will oppose any attempt by Mr Corbyn to impose a salary cap on members of the public sector. But the union is also considering whether to back a proposal from the GMB union that would see all workers receive a 1% pay rise every year until 2020.

Unions have been campaigning against such a deal since last year when they were told by ministers that their talks would be confidential until after any final agreement was reached. Now, however, both sides are saying there could be no further delay as the deadline approaches on Friday.

{"text": "Plans to create a 'super union' of workers' representatives from across Europe are being touted as a way to strengthen workers' rights and make it easier for them to negotiate with employers. The idea of a 'European Works Council' was proposed by the European Commission and is being supported by trade unions and businesses. The council would bring together representatives from both employers and employees in a number of European countries. It would allow workers to have a stronger voice in cross-border negotiations and make it easier for them to take collective action. It would also provide a platform for exchanging best practices and sharing knowledge between workers' representatives. The commission says the proposed 'super union' would be able to provide strategic advice to businesses and help them to create better working conditions for their employees.

{"text": "A proposed merger between two of the UK's largest trade unions, Unite and GMB, has been dubbed the creation of a \"super union.\" The plan, which aims to consolidate the power and influence of the labour movement, has garnered both support and skepticism from various stakeholders. Unite, led by General Secretary Len McCluskey, and GMB, led by General Secretary Gary Smith, have been engaged in talks for several months to explore the potential benefits of joining forces. The merger would result in a combined membership of around 2 million, making it the largest union in the country. Proponents argue that a merger of this scale would provide union members with increased bargaining power, enabling them to negotiate better pay, improved working conditions, and stronger job security. It is also seen as an opportunity to streamline operations and reduce costs, allowing for more efficient representation of workers' interests.

{"text": "In what is being described as a landmark move in the British labour landscape, two of the country's most influential trade unions have put forward a proposal to merge, potentially creating a 'super union'. The unions involved, which have yet to be publicly named pending formal announcements, are understood to represent a combined membership of over a million workers across a range of sectors. Sources close to the unions suggest that the proposed merger is a strategic response to the evolving challenges facing workers in the modern economy, including the rise of precarious employment, the impact of automation, and the need for more robust collective bargaining power. The move is seen as a bid to streamline resources, amplify the voice of workers and exert greater influence on policy matters. Union members are expected to be balloted on the merger, with both unions' leadership advocating a yes vote. They argue that a single, larger organization would lead to more efficient use of funds, stronger legal and strike support for members, and a louder voice in national debates.", "label": "gpt-4-1106-preview", "label_int": 7, "est_prob_list": [[4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 3.776867972479926, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091], [4.605170185988091, 3.074846734603246, 3.611207437515259, 3.912022829055786, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 2.9177416106685996, 4.605170185988091, 2.525728702545166, 4.605170185988091], [4.605170185988091, 0.3927408820018172, 0.012183671444654464, 0.8439700603485107, 4.605170185988091, 1.7215744654337566, 0.967583954334259, 0.018862129747867586, 0.24856306612491608, 1.1331265568733215], [4.605170185988091, 0.6836381806060672, 0.008081074804067612, 0.544727087020874, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 0.7133498191833496, 0.22788686752319337, 0.35159875452518463, 1.2742427587509155], [2.995732069015503, 0.17096354998648167, 0.016328807175159454, 0.891598105430603, 4.605170185988091, 2.3528262411968575, 0.8439700603485107, 0.030164575576782225, 0.26970240473747253, 1.2325519323349], [4.1588830833596715, 4.1588830833596715, 0.2824872555746769, 0.8177896257672219, 4.605170185988091, 2.2129729343043585, 4.605170185988091, 0.6776429940239801, 3.5992672954242493, 4.605170185988091], [0.6577416900019992, 0.15164437661410016, 0.003292688738168402, 0.5069183579124694, 2.5771798535560935, 3.4657359027997265, 4.605170185988091, 1.114360645636249, 4.605170185988091, 0.9908243522467244]], "target_roberta_idx": [31, 36, 38, 40, 66, 98, 151, 175, 176, 197], "target_prob_idx": [30, 35, 36, 39, 65, 97, 149, 172, 173, 194]}
{"text": "To stop caring about what other people think, it is important to shift your focus towards yourself and your own values and self-worth. Start by identifying what truly matters to you and what brings you happiness and fulfillment. By understanding your own worth and building self-confidence, the opinions of others will hold less power over you. Also, learn to practice self-compassion. Remind yourself that everyone has their own insecurities and struggles and that the judgments of others are often a reflection of their own issues rather than a true assessment of your worth. Treat yourself with kindness, accept imperfections, and learn from mistakes instead of dwelling on them. Surround yourself with supportive and positive people who uplift you rather than bring you down. Seek out those who appreciate and respect you for who you are, as this will reinforce your confidence in yourself.

{"text": "You don't. A: I'm not sure I understand the question, but if it's \"How do I get over my need to be liked?\" then there are a few things that might help. First of all, people who care more about being liked than they should probably just go ahead and like themselves anyway. If someone is constantly trying to make them feel good by making their life easier or giving them something nice, they're going to have trouble getting over this desire for approval. So maybe try doing stuff on your own without worrying so much about how other people will react. It'll take some practice at first, but eventually you won't even notice when you start feeling bad because you've been putting yourself out there in ways that aren't dependent upon whether anyone likes you or not.

It can be helpful to identify what is truly important to you and what you want to achieve in life, and then make decisions based on those things rather than trying to please others or conform to social expectations. Another strategy is to practice self-compassion and self-acceptance. This means treating yourself with kindness and understanding, and accepting yourself as you are, flaws and all. This can help you to develop a sense of self-worth that is not dependent on the opinions of others. It can also be helpful to surround yourself with supportive people who accept and support you for who you are.

{"text": "Caring about what others think is an unavoidable part of life, but it can be managed. The first step is to recognize that how you think others perceive you is not as important as how you perceive yourself. This means accepting that other people's opinions are just that - opinions - and not facts. Once you can accept that, it is easier to take back control of your life and focus on what matters to you. One way to start is to become more aware of how you talk to yourself. When you find yourself worrying about how someone will judge you, take a step back and recognize that thought. Ask yourself why you care and what it would take to let it go. Is it something you can change? If so, take action. If not, let it go. Practicing self-compassion is also important; be kind and understanding with yourself and give yourself permission to make mistakes.", "label": "alpaca-7b", "label_int": 5, "est_prob_list": [[4.1331152121226, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091], [3.523522032631768, 3.2188758850097656, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 3.912022829055786, 4.274829423427581, 3.9120230674743652, 3.5988323092460632], [0.20456708098451296, 0.02020268701016903, 3.912022829055786, 1.1506478488445282, 3.2188758850097656, 3.2188758850097656, 0.010050326585769653, 2.886102890968323, 0.4004775285720825, 0.4004775285720825], [0.1554159869750341, 1.7719568014144897, 1.289076531660197, 0.6827864278740542, 0.22274854128014115, 0.2876819968223572, 0.010050326585769653, 0.6362121437285131, 0.35891772696395935, 0.32244337766828546], [0.2053977611164252, 0.7765287756919861, 4.605170185988091, 1.7092999418576558, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 0.0, 1.5534198462963105, 1.8971199989318848, 1.8971199989318848], [0.2221674653411543, 0.5212969236332861, 1.6133518117552368, 4.605170185988091, 1.311070939882303, 2.5006550067561393, 2.906120114864304, 4.605170185988091, 1.0908301482260547, 4.605170185988091], [1.3555227024531369, 1.6739764335716716, 2.772588722239781, 3.4657359027997265, 2.906120114864304, 1.9075912847531766, 0.5082248420659333, 4.1588830833596715, 2.906120114864304, 2.2870809064580806]], "target_roberta_idx": [36, 53, 76, 127, 128, 129, 150, 157, 163, 164], "target_prob_idx": [34, 51, 74, 125, 126, 127, 148, 155, 157, 158]}
{"text": "Effectively stopping caring about what others think requires a shift in mindset and a conscious effort to prioritize one's own happiness and self-acceptance. Here are a few strategies that can help: 1. Recognize the root of the problem: Understanding why you care so much about others' opinions is crucial. Often, it stems from seeking validation or fearing judgment. Reflect on past experiences or insecurities that might be contributing to this mindset. 2. Focus on self-acceptance: Embrace your strengths and weaknesses, and remind yourself that no one is perfect. Practice self-compassion and cultivate a positive self-image. When you have a strong sense of self-worth, others' opinions will hold less weight. 3. Challenge negative thoughts: When you catch yourself worrying about others' opinions, challenge those thoughts. Ask yourself if they are rational or if they are based on assumptions. Often, we catastrophize and imagine judgment where it may not exist. 4.", "label": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "label_int": 6, "est_prob_list": [[2.8784815073013306, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 3.9120230674743652, 3.9120230674743652, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091], [4.605170185988091, 3.0829089879989624, 2.207274913787842, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091], [0.10144077986478806, 0.07257068157196045, 0.0, 0.051293306052684784, 0.0, 1.478320278848211, 0.0, 4.605170185988091, 2.5, 0.0], [0.6354366932064295, 0.7133498787879944, 0.051293306052684784, 3.5065579414367676, 0.0, 2.6080153783162436, 0.0, 4.605170185988091, 2.5544280111789703, 0.07257068157196045], [0.13273155689239502, 0.23572230339050293, 0.0, 0.07257068157196045, 0.0, 1.1431989669799805, 0.0, 4.605170185988091, 2.5075377449393272, 0.010050326585769653], [0.639902666041133, 4.605170185988091, 7.941713140650478e-05, 0.06622783200564458, 0.0007069188370181875, 1.046277241042498, 3.506557897319982, 0.44870850004789714, 2.906120114864304, 0.00016943235350990712], [1.2685113254635072, 4.1588830833596715, 0.8630462173553428, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 1.5939337258981352, 4.605170185988091, 0.6473376445286511, 4.605170185988091, 2.2129729343043585]], "target_roberta_idx": [35, 77, 83, 106, 138, 144, 146, 168, 169, 170], "target_prob_idx": [30, 71, 75, 94, 119, 125, 127, 149, 150, 151]}

She's been on a mission, but she comes home early because she wants to spend some quality time with her mom before she dies. It was really touching how they showed that scene. And then there were also scenes where Mila Kunis' character had to fight off an alien invasion. I thought it was pretty cool how they made those fights look like real battles between humans and aliens.

If you can't see it, then you're not going to be able to achieve it.\" - Mark Twain I've been thinking a lot about this lately as I have had a number of setbacks recently. It's hard to motivate yourself when you feel like you're failing at something that you know you should be doing. The key is to find ways to get back up after you fall down. Here are some tips from my friend, Dr. David Burns, who has written several books on motivation and self-development. 1) Find a goal that you want to accomplish. 2) Set realistic goals. 3) Be honest with yourself about what you can do. 4) Don't let negative thoughts control you. 5) Keep your expectations realistic. 6) Focus on the present moment. 7) Take time out to relax.", "label": "gpt2-xl", "label_int": 1, "est_prob_list": [[2.6592600345611572, 3.956533511479696, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 3.8004512786865234, 3.9120230674743652, 3.362716883420944, 3.9120230674743652], [1.1711828708648682, 4.605170185988091, 4.593905538320541, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 3.251145124435425, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091], [1.5141277313232422, 1.249571442604065, 0.8519938886165619, 0.5349832475185394, 0.5798184871673584, 1.280550330877304, 4.605170185988091, 0.7339692115783691, 0.7339692115783691, 4.605170185988091], [2.1202635765075684, 0.9974061548709869, 0.2007367213567098, 0.8201793134212494, 0.7339692115783691, 1.3190880119800568, 4.605170185988091, 0.9416084885597229, 0.9416084885597229, 4.605170185988091], [1.9661128520965576, 1.194275697072347, 0.4232522249221802, 0.8951703459024429, 0.6733445525169373, 1.071315661072731, 4.605170185988091, 0.41551539301872253, 0.41551539301872253, 4.605170185988091], [0.930056927638303, 0.33024168687057687, 2.772588722239781, 0.2369097470783577, 0.9602099658089905, 0.2824872555746769, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 0.2369097470783577], [1.0453677741492975, 0.6035350218702582, 3.7534179752515073, 0.18859116980755003, 2.018816919863401, 1.114360645636249, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 0.43318965612301924]], "target_roberta_idx": [43, 44, 47, 64, 65, 66, 102, 121, 123, 129], "target_prob_idx": [43, 44, 47, 64, 65, 66, 102, 118, 120, 126]}

In this article we will look at a few of these tools that can help you stay focused on your goals and keep yourself moving forward towards achieving success. 1) Be Realistic About Your Goals The first thing you need to do before setting any goal is to be realistic about it. If you set unrealistic expectations then there's no way you can achieve those goals. It doesn't matter if they seem impossible because what matters most is whether you actually accomplish them or not. So make sure that whatever goals you have set are achievable within your means.

{"text": "Yes. We can measure the degree of awareness in a computer program by measuring how long it takes for it to respond to a particular input, and we can also use this information to predict when an agent will make a decision based on its current state. The most common way to measure awareness is through EEG (electroencephalogram) recordings. These are recorded from the scalp using electrodes placed over the brain's surface. When an electrical signal is generated in one part of the brain, it travels down the length of the wire that connects the electrode to the recording device. This signal is then amplified and sent to a receiver where it is decoded into a series of numbers representing the intensity of the signal at each point along the wire.", "label": "gpt2-xl", "label_int": 1, "est_prob_list": [[2.525728702545166, 2.713075280189514, 3.2188756465911865, 3.2188758850097656, 3.045105014528547, 3.145737588405609, 4.605170185988091, 2.6592600345611572, 2.9957322120666503, 2.995732069015503], [2.6592600345611572, 2.939067840576172, 3.2188756465911865, 3.5065579414367676, 4.1511625562395364, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 2.6592600345611572, 3.406877326965332, 1.6094379425048828], [3.077658843994141, 1.0216511487960815, 0.5158507376909256, 1.752903978029887, 2.2964320182800293, 0.1984509527683258, 1.7499694526195526, 3.912022829055786, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091], [2.169552230834961, 2.0402207374572754, 1.0353399580344558, 3.1403538386027017, 2.878779479435512, 1.6094379425048828, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 0.9162907004356384, 0.9162907004356384], [3.287550354003906, 1.2039726972579956, 0.6276329699903727, 1.7761901219685872, 2.5683799130576, 0.6931470632553101, 1.5417909224828084, 2.6592600345611572, 3.9120230674743652, 3.9120230674743652], [2.906120114864304, 4.605170185988091, 3.4657359027997265, 4.446565155811453, 1.934259531835338, 3.147282171681192, 1.3707901745839253, 4.1588830833596715, 2.6548056865833978, 0.16068238169047347], [2.2129729343043585, 4.1588830833596715, 3.7534179752515073, 4.605170185988091, 2.6548056865833978, 1.9616585060234524, 1.0908301482260547, 2.5494451709255714, 0.9007865453381898, 0.22705745063534608]], "target_roberta_idx": [27, 38, 39, 47, 48, 74, 75, 82, 126, 127], "target_prob_idx": [26, 37, 38, 46, 47, 68, 69, 77, 120, 121]}

While there is no consensus on a definitive answer, here are some brief perspectives on each question: 1. Does AI have consciousness? Currently, AI systems do not possess consciousness in the way humans do. AI systems are programmed to perform specific tasks and operate within predetermined parameters, lacking the self-awareness, subjective experience, and intentionality that define human consciousness. However, as AI systems become more advanced and sophisticated, the question of whether they can develop a form of consciousness remains an open one.

Measuring awareness in AI systems is challenging because their behavior is based on programmed rules and data patterns rather than conscious experience. However, AI can demonstrate certain aspects of awareness, such as recognizing objects, understanding language, or perceiving patterns in data. These abilities are measured through performance metrics and benchmarks that evaluate the accuracy and efficiency of AI systems in specific tasks.

{"text": "As of my knowledge cutoff in 2023, AI does not have consciousness. Current AI systems, including sophisticated machine learning models and neural networks, operate based on algorithms and data without subjective experiences, feelings, or self-awareness. They can perform tasks that require pattern recognition, decision-making, and even learning, but these processes are fundamentally different from human consciousness. Measuring awareness, or consciousness, is a complex issue that is not fully resolved. There are several approaches to assessing consciousness, such as: 1. Behavioral Tests: These are based on observable responses to stimuli, like the Turing Test, which evaluates if an AI can exhibit behavior indistinguishable from a human. However, this does not directly measure consciousness but rather the ability to mimic human-like responses. 2.", "label": "gpt-4-1106-preview", "label_int": 7, "est_prob_list": [[4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.074108328670263, 4.605170185988091, 4.197436613195083], [4.58879828453064, 3.5065579414367676, 4.431883454322815, 3.6438844799995422, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 3.2188758850097656, 3.1576705680173984], [0.8414816359678904, 1.9661128520965576, 0.21658271551132202, 0.6660712994635105, 2.6592600345611572, 0.39769967645406723, 2.6592600345611572, 4.605170185988091, 1.26627679169178, 2.028825044631958], [2.0749977827072144, 1.9661128520965576, 0.6542765595950186, 2.513882970204577, 4.605170185988091, 0.9026799499988556, 2.525728702545166, 3.9120230674743652, 0.8381066113710404, 2.4931976549765644], [0.6182586252689362, 0.8439700603485107, 0.11201312625780702, 0.3094685971736908, 1.2378743886947632, 0.6381824761629105, 2.3025851249694824, 4.605170185988091, 1.178352728486061, 1.8579037329729866], [1.6133518117552368, 0.7576857016975165, 1.7609878105613013, 4.605170185988091, 0.33569129163814154, 3.5992672954242493, 4.446565155811453, 2.906120114864304, 0.6325225587435105, 1.881615798349916], [0.4695706900301541, 0.34570408840430233, 1.067840630001356, 0.21051844578293086, 0.3633938941874773, 2.4541349911212467, 4.605170185988091, 3.0602707946915624, 0.46197586635895566, 0.23901850323318616]], "target_roberta_idx": [24, 25, 34, 39, 41, 50, 85, 88, 120, 128], "target_prob_idx": [22, 23, 32, 37, 39, 46, 78, 81, 113, 121]}

{"text": "There are two main ways that we can look at this data, either as an overall picture or broken down into different groups. The first way is to see how many males and females buy each type of album. This gives us some idea about what kind of music men and women like. We also get a general idea about which ages prefer certain kinds of music. For example, it seems that most teenagers listen to pop/dance music while older adults tend towards classical music. However, there are exceptions to these trends; for instance, young children seem to be more interested in rock than any other group. In addition, we know from previous research (see question 2) that younger people have less money available so they may not be able to afford all the expensive CDs.

{"text": "The two graphs provided depict the popularity of music albums among people in Britain based on their age and gender. The data is presented for both male and female consumers in five-year age groups, ranging from 15-19 years old to 60-64 years old. Overall, it is evident that the purchasing habits of male and female consumers differ significantly across age groups. For instance, in the 15-19 age group, male consumers tend to prefer rock and pop music, while female consumers show a greater interest in pop and dance music. In contrast, the 20-24 age group displays a more balanced music taste, with both genders showing an equal preference for rock, pop, and dance music. As the age groups progress, the preference for rock music declines, and the interest in classical music increases among both genders.

The main function of this organelle is to receive signals from other neurons or muscles in order to send them on to another area of the brain where they can be processed. A signal received by one neuron will cause changes in its membrane potential which causes action potentials (AP) to travel along the length of the axon. These AP are then transmitted through synapses at the end of each branch of the axon. When these reach the next neuron they trigger neurotransmitters to release into the synaptic cleft causing chemical reactions inside the postsynaptic neuron.", "label": "gpt-j-6b", "label_int": 2, "est_prob_list": [[4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 3.933260440826416, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.406291961669922], [2.6592600345611572, 3.912022829055786, 3.5065579414367676, 3.3437627742865255, 2.6592600345611572, 3.9120230674743652, 3.5065579414367676, 3.6728761196136475, 2.502172017097473, 3.179614861806234], [1.8775096535682678, 4.605170185988091, 0.015229589305818081, 0.021982818309749876, 0.0, 2.1168391406536102, 4.605170185988091, 4.602923860604113, 0.13501592874526977, 0.4096995045741399], [4.605170185988091, 1.2729655504226685, 0.0, 0.13483671524694987, 0.0, 0.9528923351317644, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 0.5813523322343827, 1.6666666666666667], [2.9215222597122192, 1.3470735549926758, 0.025646653026342392, 0.19126591086387634, 0.0, 1.6908865869045258, 4.605170185988091, 2.1212373369119386, 0.31086580753326415, 1.6666666666666667], [1.6133518117552368, 0.3087354816496133, 0.19331931100349597, 0.40351388797690263, 0.8817383503674954, 3.7534179752515073, 0.7493868988828214, 1.467640000573843, 0.22705745063534608, 4.605170185988091], [2.906120114864304, 0.3746934494414107, 0.16989903679539747, 0.3522205935893521, 1.1384581972153094, 4.605170185988091, 1.5198257537444133, 0.9007865453381898, 0.5479651707154474, 4.605170185988091]], "target_roberta_idx": [30, 44, 47, 49, 61, 72, 93, 105, 136, 141], "target_prob_idx": [27, 39, 42, 44, 56, 67, 87, 98, 125, 129]}

Areas allocated for sheep and goats and olives cultivation were converted into tourist shops and farmland for harvesting fruits and vegetables to serve tourists at hotels.A portion of village, harbour and place were boats were stationed has been relocated to accommodate tourists to have a sea view.A pathway has been created from top of the mountain to the beach to facilitate tourist travel different destinations. Consequently, there has been a huge loss in habitat and probably a shift in fishermen jobs. For survival, fishermen would have taken up jobs like working in tourist shops, serving tourists at restaurant and guiding tourists.", "label": "human", "label_int": 0, "est_prob_list": [[4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.049195911203112], [4.605170185988091, 4.133015156997065, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 3.632215142250061, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091], [1.2026696275743605, 3.734853688097943, 1.2971445526834429, 4.605170185988091, 1.1086626052856445, 1.2301204312184029, 2.1539158139910017, 4.605170185988091, 3.8366817235946655, 4.287946125409616], [2.5032293592815336, 3.5065577030181885, 0.8766394853591919, 4.605170185988091, 1.2651552535257606, 0.7656618721783162, 2.316282176153398, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 0.8139754108020237], [1.1282518679396798, 4.216303619227393, 1.0091452178686304, 4.605170185988091, 1.694880622940062, 1.5673112516230636, 1.8537996164238246, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 2.1870997208421445], [3.347952867143343, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 0.3746934494414107, 4.1588830833596715, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 0.6035350218702582, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091], [3.7534179752515073, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 0.22705745063534608, 1.9616585060234524, 4.1588830833596715, 4.605170185988091, 0.8266785731844679, 4.605170185988091, 1.9075912847531766]], "target_roberta_idx": [25, 30, 67, 91, 93, 94, 120, 132, 139, 156], "target_prob_idx": [22, 27, 58, 79, 81, 82, 105, 117, 124, 139]}
{"text": "In this article I will discuss how the development of the town of Bruges was influenced by the arrival of the Romans in Europe. The Roman Empire had been established for over two centuries when the first inhabitants arrived from Britain. They were originally called Britons but later became known as Gauls or Belgae. The name 'Burgundy' is derived from the Latin word Burgundia which means 'the land of the Burgundians'. The Roman Emperor Hadrian (117-138 AD) granted the British people their independence on 1 January A.D. 54. This was followed by the establishment of the Kingdom of Britannia in 1299. In 1337 King Edward III of England gave his daughter Margaret to the Pope in exchange for the throne of France. The French king Louis IX (1327-1404) also made an agreement with the Pope in 1405 that he would give up all claims to the English crown if the latter would recognise the rights of the French kings. However, the treaty did not come into effect until 1529.", "label": "gpt2-xl", "label_int": 1, "est_prob_list": [[3.912022829055786, 3.2668226938694715, 2.813410758972168, 2.813410758972168, 2.813410758972168, 3.912022829055786, 3.912022829055786, 3.637369990348816, 3.2188756465911865, 3.2188756465911865], [3.9120230674743652, 3.2775793025890985, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.157230317592621, 3.2188758850097656, 3.2188758850097656], [0.3424903452396393, 2.739478295048078, 0.10536054521799088, 0.10536054521799088, 0.3856624662876129, 0.16251890361309052, 0.33118317027886707, 1.309333324432373, 0.010050326585769653, 0.06881008545557658], [0.6931471824645996, 2.331574559211731, 0.02020268701016903, 0.02020268701016903, 1.9661128520965576, 0.41551539301872253, 1.6100217401981354, 1.469675898551941, 0.0, 0.09589402874310811], [0.16251890361309052, 1.5037171517809231, 0.11653383076190948, 0.11653383076190948, 0.7985077500343323, 0.21072103083133698, 0.48103106518586475, 1.3470735549926758, 0.010050326585769653, 0.08527431885401408], [1.9898293829901488, 4.605170185988091, 0.048009219186360606, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 0.2369097470783577, 4.446565155811453, 4.446565155811453, 3.5992672954242493, 2.0794415416798357], [2.5494451709255714, 4.1588830833596715, 0.27731928541623435, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 0.3746934494414107, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 3.0602707946915624, 2.2870809064580806]], "target_roberta_idx": [25, 26, 55, 56, 58, 121, 122, 132, 143, 144], "target_prob_idx": [22, 23, 52, 53, 54, 103, 104, 112, 122, 123]}
{"text": "Fishing villages are usually located on or near to coastlines in order to provide easy access for fishermen to fish at sea. The coastal location is also important as it provides protection from storms and other weather conditions that can damage boats and nets. However, this means that there will be no land available for farming so people must rely on what they catch themselves. This leads to an increase in population which causes problems such as overcrowding and lack of space. In addition, many fishing villages have been built along rivers because these offer good natural shelter from bad weather but again lead to overpopulation. As a result, most fishing villages become very crowded with little room for expansion. In contrast to fishing villages, tourism has developed rapidly since the 1950s due to increased leisure time and improved transport links. Tourism brings benefits to both tourists and local residents. Tourists spend money locally while locals benefit financially through employment opportunities created by the influx of visitors.", "label": "gpt-j-6b", "label_int": 2, "est_prob_list": [[4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 3.9120230674743652, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.12127012014389], [1.7719568014144897, 1.7719568014144897, 2.6993734935919442, 3.2188758850097656, 3.912022829055786, 3.9120230674743652, 2.995732307434082, 4.605170185988091, 2.1969848058440467, 4.123901791870594], [0.3952697142958641, 0.6161860823631287, 2.384489986631605, 2.6592600345611572, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 2.516347659485681, 0.4104902446269989, 2.1743135777386753, 0.20427019917406142], [1.171703539788723, 2.3025851249694824, 0.890654782868094, 0.9416084289550781, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 0.46317051351070404, 4.605170185988091, 0.0], [0.8760770261287689, 1.0788096189498901, 2.6758213655816183, 1.4271163940429688, 2.0613718926906586, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 0.21546835359185934, 4.605170185988091, 0.060664908960461617], [2.1439800628174073, 0.07711730334443129, 4.1588830833596715, 4.605170185988091, 0.13800567301944372, 1.102526187989246, 4.605170185988091, 2.6548056865833978, 4.605170185988091, 0.4575811092471784], [3.7534179752515073, 0.561570822771226, 3.7534179752515073, 4.605170185988091, 0.18859116980755003, 0.38612214526503347, 4.605170185988091, 1.3256697393034558, 4.605170185988091, 0.39768296766610944]], "target_roberta_idx": [32, 33, 59, 62, 77, 86, 123, 136, 176, 185], "target_prob_idx": [29, 30, 56, 59, 74, 82, 118, 131, 169, 178]}

{"text": "The two maps depict the transformation of a small fishing village into a bustling European tourist resort. The first map shows the initial layout of the village, with a few fishing boats and buildings clustered around the coastline. The second map displays the drastic changes that occurred over time, with the addition of numerous hotels, restaurants, and other tourist attractions. The most striking feature of the second map is the dramatic expansion of the village. The coastline has been developed with numerous tourist facilities, including a marina, a yacht club, and a beachfront promenade. The village itself has grown significantly, with new roads and buildings extending inland to accommodate the influx of tourists. Another notable change is the replacement of traditional fishing boats with larger, luxury yachts. This suggests that the village has shifted from a fishing-based economy to one that relies heavily on tourism. The increase in tourist attractions and amenities also suggests that the village has become a popular destination for tourists from around Europe.", "label": "vicuna-13b-v1.5", "label_int": 4, "est_prob_list": [[3.607924163341522, 3.912022829055786, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 3.9120230674743652, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091], [4.202810764312744, 2.995732307434082, 4.605170185988091, 3.680973847707113, 3.2188756465911865, 4.605170185988091, 3.5065579414367676, 2.525728464126587, 2.525728464126587, 4.605170185988091], [1.790661871433258, 0.6931470632553101, 0.0, 0.01709776868422826, 0.051293306052684784, 0.21072103083133698, 1.1394343376159668, 1.8325815200805664, 4.605170185988091, 0.46203547716140747], [1.112141564488411, 0.6733444333076477, 0.0067002177238464355, 0.023797986408074696, 0.051293306052684784, 0.41551530361175537, 1.0788096189498901, 2.813410758972168, 2.6106780767440796, 0.7550225853919983], [0.6674237095628682, 0.5843130982568117, 0.0, 0.005632821454999128, 0.0, 0.1692898817061003, 0.41686322085208016, 0.6497461025834309, 2.904571533203125, 0.3542467235633768], [0.8538295622504187, 2.3263016196113617, 3.0602707946915624, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 1.3862943611198906, 2.8371272433773522, 1.6533571463689358, 0.05623971832287608, 2.772588722239781], [1.7609878105613013, 2.2129729343043585, 2.906120114864304, 4.605170185988091, 4.1588830833596715, 3.0602707946915624, 3.7534179752515073, 0.7411563997463059, 0.2076393647782445, 3.0602707946915624]], "target_roberta_idx": [30, 31, 42, 43, 44, 52, 114, 141, 142, 177], "target_prob_idx": [29, 30, 41, 42, 43, 51, 109, 136, 137, 168]}

{"text": "Elvis fans around the world have been marking the legendary singer's 70th birthday on Saturday. A three-day Elvis convention took place in Blackpool, England, over the weekend with the aim of finding the best European Elvis impersonator. His Graceland, Tennessee, home was the focus for US celebrations with four days of events including a concert by the Memphis Symphony Orchestra. Elvis' single Jailhouse Rock became the UK's number one on Sunday. Fans in France celebrated with a tribute concert by Elvis cover bands and a special exhibition of memorabilia is on display in Bonn, Germany. Jailhouse Rock is now the 999th number one single in UK pop history.

In addition, many officers who should have retired early due to poor health or age remained on active duty because they believed that their country needed them. This led to an overstuffed officer corps with too few experienced commanders. In 1938 Hitler decided to rearm Germany as part of his plan to conquer Europe.

{"text": "Germany bit off more than it could chew during World War II due to a combination of factors. One of the main reasons was Adolf Hitler's overconfidence and his belief in the superiority of the German military. He underestimated the resources and capabilities of the countries he invaded, assuming that quick and decisive victories could be achieved. This led to a series of miscalculations and strategic errors. Germany's initial success in the war, particularly with the Blitzkrieg tactics used in the invasion of Poland and France, further fueled Hitler's confidence.

This ambition fueled aggressive expansion without consideration for the sustainability of long-term occupation and governance. 2. **Underestimation of Opponents**: Hitler and the Nazi leadership underestimated the resilience and industrial capacity of the Soviet Union and the potential for the United States to enter the war.

{"text": "The trial of Bernie Ebbers, former chief executive of bankrupt US phone company WorldCom, has started in New York with the selection of the jury. Mr Ebbers, 63, is accused of being the mastermind behind an $11bn (\u00a36bn) accounting fraud that eventually saw the firm collapse in July 2002. His indictment includes charges of securities fraud, conspiracy and filing false reports with regulators. If found guilty, Mr Ebbers could face a substantial jail sentence. He has firmly declared his innocence. Under Mr Ebbers' leadership, WorldCom emerged from Mississippi obscurity to become a $160bn telecoms giant and the darling of late 1990s investors. Yet as competition intensified and the telecoms boom petered out, WorldCom found itself under growing financial stress. When WorldCom finally collapsed, shareholders lost about $180bn and 20,000 workers lost their jobs. Mr Ebbers' trial, which is expected to last two months, is the latest in a series of attempts by US prosecutors to pursue senior executives for fraud. It will coincide with the retrial of former Tyco International chief Dennis Kozlowski and his top lieutenant, accused of looting the industrial conglomerate to the tune of $600m.

{"text": "The WorldCom trial is the first major criminal case to be heard by a jury since the 9/11 attacks. The trial will take place at the federal courthouse in Manhattan, and it could lead to the conviction of senior executives from the company for fraud and conspiracy. It's been almost two years since the company was hit with allegations that it had defrauded its customers out of $1.8bn (\u00a31.2bn). In May last year, the US government charged seven former employees of WorldCom with conspiring to commit wire fraud, mail fraud and securities fraud. In June, the company agreed to pay $3.4bn (\u00a32.6bn) in fines and penalties after admitting that it had overcharged for services such as telephone service and internet access. It also admitted that it had misled investors about how much money it made from its business. But the company has refused to admit any wrongdoing or pay back any of the money it owes. Instead, it has filed an appeal against the fine, arguing that the charges are too broad and that they should not apply to the company's \"core\" operations.

The prosecution is seeking to prove that Mr Ebbers committed fraud by concealing billions of dollars worth of losses from investors during his tenure as head of one of America's biggest telecoms companies. He faces up to 20 years in prison if convicted on all counts. Mr Ebbers' defence team says he was not aware of any wrongdoing until after leaving office last year. They say there were legitimate reasons for accounting changes made under him. Prosecutors have said they will call more than 100 witnesses over three weeks. Among them are several senior executives who worked with Mr Ebbers while he headed WorldCom between 1994 and 2002. They include Jeffrey Skilling, the former boss of Enron Corp., which collapsed into bankruptcy earlier this year following an investigation into financial irregularities.

{"text": "The trial of former WorldCom CEO Bernard Ebbers and other executives accused of orchestrating a massive accounting fraud at the telecoms company has begun in New York. Ebbers, along with former chief financial officer Scott Sullivan and former controller David Myers, are accused of inflating the company's earnings by billions of dollars through a series of complex accounting schemes. Prosecutors say that the executives misled investors and employees about the company's financial health, and that they profited handsomely from the fraud. The trial is expected to last several weeks, and could result in lengthy prison sentences for the defendants if they are found guilty. WorldCom filed for bankruptcy in 2002, after it was discovered that the company had inflated its earnings by $3.8 billion. The scandal led to the collapse of the company and the loss of thousands of jobs. The case is being closely watched by investors and regulators, as it is one of the largest accounting fraud cases in recent years.

{"text": "The highly anticipated trial of former executives from the telecommunications giant WorldCom began today at a federal court in New York. The trial follows one of the largest accounting fraud scandals in American history. The prosecution alleges that the defendants, including former CEO Bernard Ebbers, orchestrated a scheme to artificially inflate WorldCom's earnings and deceive investors. They argue that this fraud allowed the company to report billions of dollars in false profits between 1999 and 2002. The trial is expected to focus on the actions of the accused during this period, including their knowledge and involvement in the fraudulent accounting practices. Key witnesses, including former WorldCom employees, auditors, and financial experts, are expected to testify against the defendants. WorldCom, which once boasted being the second-largest long-distance telecommunications company in the United States, filed for bankruptcy in 2002, with debts totaling over $40 billion. The scandal sent shockwaves through the financial markets, leading to increased scrutiny of corporate accounting practices and the passage of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act to prevent future accounting fraud. If convicted, the defendants could face significant prison sentences and hefty fines. The trial is expected to last several months, with the prosecution presenting a mountain of evidence, including financial records and witness testimonies.", "label": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "label_int": 6, "est_prob_list": [[4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.063828557729721, 4.605170185988091, 3.9120230674743652, 4.605170185988091, 3.7417007386684418, 4.605170185988091, 3.7492466994694302], [4.605170185988091, 3.9120230674743652, 4.605170185988091, 4.079583648592234, 2.525728464126587, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 3.2466277480125427, 3.6531117984226773, 4.605170185988091], [0.5621327649801969, 1.7176844345198736, 0.7133498787879944, 0.5350124090909958, 0.04082195460796356, 3.912022829055786, 2.2354416166033064, 1.32000989979133, 0.03652382322720119, 0.6298610993794033], [0.4842823505401611, 1.058136264483134, 0.7550225853919983, 0.571317610796541, 0.3856624662876129, 3.2188758850097656, 1.839357648577009, 0.0659952606074512, 0.03329538021768842, 0.9459749630519322], [0.6841404616832734, 2.101664145787557, 0.7550225853919983, 0.5687795206904411, 0.010050326585769653, 1.7719568014144897, 1.0125467436654227, 1.0575416162610054, 0.03329538021768842, 0.3775290165628706], [0.3509127480815464, 0.7594826513678375, 0.15969377956277844, 3.242592351485517, 0.007384808648130677, 0.38591380159751776, 0.3023264559791493, 0.05870973941385632, 4.1588830833596715, 0.2124586512141934], [1.7165360479904674, 3.242592351485517, 0.39768296766610944, 2.2129729343043585, 0.2569104137850272, 0.7088955375280844, 1.4180430594344708, 0.9202046311952914, 4.605170185988091, 0.3194307707663612]], "target_roberta_idx": [31, 45, 60, 62, 75, 78, 79, 91, 205, 230], "target_prob_idx": [29, 43, 56, 57, 70, 73, 74, 86, 187, 212]}
{"text": "The trial of former WorldCom CEO Bernard Ebbers commenced today in a New York courtroom, marking the beginning of a legal battle over one of the largest corporate fraud scandals in American history. Ebbers, who is facing charges of fraud, conspiracy, and filing false documents with regulators, has pleaded not guilty to all counts. Jury selection was completed early in the day, with a diverse group of individuals sworn in to determine the fate of the man who once helmed the telecommunications giant. WorldCom's collapse in 2002, which led to an $11 billion accounting scandal, not only shook the corporate world but also cost investors billions and led to the loss of thousands of jobs. Prosecutors allege that Ebbers was the mastermind behind a scheme to inflate the company's assets to maintain its stock price and to give an impression of financial stability. The defense, however, maintains that Ebbers was unaware of the financial manipulations, which they claim were orchestrated by underlings without his knowledge. The trial is expected to feature testimony from several former WorldCom executives, including the company's former Chief Financial Officer, Scott Sullivan, who has already pled guilty to his role in the scandal and is anticipated to be a key witness for the prosecution.", "label": "gpt-4-1106-preview", "label_int": 7, "est_prob_list": [[4.605170185988091, 3.3453803658485413, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.3566795825958256, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091], [4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 2.813410758972168, 2.813410758972168, 2.813410758972168, 1.7147983312606812, 4.605170185988091, 4.327911376953125, 4.605170185988091, 3.6039576530456543], [2.525728464126587, 0.0, 4.605170185988091, 3.07011349995931, 0.0, 0.6348782181739807, 0.15082287788391113, 0.04524686336517334, 4.605170185988091, 0.2202089031537374], [1.469675898551941, 0.0, 4.605170185988091, 2.003889100626111, 0.02020268701016903, 0.2231435328722, 0.1743532121181488, 0.0655576016753912, 3.9120230674743652, 0.4263748468624221], [2.995732307434082, 0.0, 4.605170185988091, 2.3410554031531015, 0.010050326585769653, 0.7339692115783691, 0.051293306052684784, 0.015387991815805436, 4.605170185988091, 0.31610288222630817], [1.3555227024531369, 1.0453677741492975, 0.39768296766610944, 4.605170185988091, 0.07711730334443129, 0.47627324225933093, 4.446565155811453, 3.4657359027997265, 0.5964175541013942, 1.0343179379627125], [1.743208589951425, 6.82725003831114e-05, 0.6098610189547681, 4.605170185988091, 1.1384581972153094, 0.43318965612301924, 3.242592351485517, 2.4541349911212467, 0.5539348443488198, 1.2144441041932315]], "target_roberta_idx": [23, 77, 112, 114, 115, 146, 161, 162, 189, 210], "target_prob_idx": [20, 73, 106, 108, 109, 139, 153, 154, 179, 198]}

{"text": "Volkswagen AG, the German automotive giant, is reportedly mulling over the possibility of opening a new production facility in India as part of its strategy to increase its market presence in emerging economies. This move comes amidst the company's efforts to tap into the growing demand for automobiles in the country, which is currently dominated by players like Maruti Suzuki and Hyundai. India's growing middle class and its potential as a vehicle manufacturing hub make it an attractive destination for international carmakers. Volkswagen's potential investment in a plant would likely bolster its competitive edge and provide a significant boost to the 'Make in India' initiative, which aims to turn the country into a global manufacturing powerhouse.

{"text": "A strike on the Buenos Aires underground has caused traffic chaos and large queues at bus stops in the Argentine capital. Tube workers walked out last week demanding a 53% pay rise and in protest against the installation of automatic ticket machines. Metrovias, the private firm which runs the five tube lines in the city, has offered an 8% increase in wages. The firm promised no jobs would be lost as a result of new ticket machines. It said it would put this commitment on paper. Underground staff have warned they will continue with the protests until the management put an acceptable offer on the table. The Argentine Work Ministry has been mediating in the conflict and it could call an \"obligatory conciliation\", which would force both sides to find a solution and put an end to the conflict. Some tube commuters have not hidden their frustration at the ongoing strike and have broken the windows of the underground trains, according to the local press. \"We are taken as hostages.

{"text": "The Argentine capital was brought to a standstill on Monday as thousands of workers went on strike in protest at the government's plans for privatisation. The country is facing an economic crisis and many people are angry that President Carlos Menem has been trying to sell off state-owned companies, including railways. Railways have traditionally played a key role in Argentina but they were nationalised by former president Juan Peron in 1976 after he took power following a military coup. He died two years later when his plane crashed into the sea while returning from exile in Spain. Mr Menem says it will be difficult to find buyers for the railway network because there are no other countries with such extensive rail networks. But unions say the plan would mean job losses and higher fares.

The strike, called by the city's train union, began early on Monday morning and has affected both the city's underground and suburban train networks. Thousands of passengers have been left stranded, with many taking to social media to express their frustration at the disruption. The union is protesting against plans to privatize the city's train network, which they say will lead to job losses and a decline in service quality. The strike has caused chaos for commuters, with many taking to the streets to demand an end to the disruption. The city's government has urged the union to return to the negotiating table, but so far no resolution has been reached. The strike has also caused delays to other forms of public transport, including buses and taxis, as people seek alternative ways to get to work.

{"text": "A major train strike has paralyzed the transportation system in Buenos Aires, causing chaos and inconvenience for thousands of commuters. The strike, which began early this morning, was called by the train workers' union in protest against the government's proposed wage cuts and job losses. As a result of the strike, all train services in and around the city have been suspended, leaving passengers stranded and unable to reach their destinations. Long queues have formed at bus stops and taxi ranks as people scramble to find alternative modes of transportation. The strike has also sparked heated debates between the union and the government. Union representatives argue that the proposed wage cuts and job losses are unfair and will have a detrimental impact on their livelihoods.

The strike, which began at midnight, was called by several workers' unions after negotiations with the rail companies broke down. Thousands of commuters were left stranded as all train services in the metropolitan area were suspended. The usually bustling train stations were eerily quiet, with only the occasional announcement apologizing for the disruption breaking the silence. Union leaders have stated that the strike action was a last resort after talks failed to produce a satisfactory offer from the employers. They are demanding a 20% pay rise, improved safety measures, and better working hours to combat what they describe as \"excessive\" overtime. The government has urged both sides to return to the negotiation table, warning that the strike is having a severe impact on the economy of the capital, particularly as it comes at a time when the city is trying to recover from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.", "label": "gpt-4-1106-preview", "label_int": 7, "est_prob_list": [[4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 3.9120230674743652, 3.5065579414367676, 3.641356905301412, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091], [4.605170185988091, 3.9120230674743652, 3.9120230674743652, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 3.367528828481833, 4.605170185988091, 4.055864095687866, 3.5065579414367676], [0.040822017937898636, 0.040822017937898636, 0.3673849320039153, 0.14886616170406342, 0.051293306052684784, 3.2188758850097656, 4.605170185988091, 0.010050326585769653, 4.605170185988091, 0.3856624662876129], [0.7133498787879944, 0.7133498787879944, 0.35983774065971375, 0.14584499970078468, 0.4004775285720825, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 0.030459178611636162, 4.605170185988091, 1.3862943649291992], [0.4780358076095581, 0.4780358076095581, 0.6248307325877249, 0.041310474276542664, 0.21072103083133698, 2.995732307434082, 4.605170185988091, 0.1053604781627655, 4.605170185988091, 0.6931470632553101], [2.2129729343043585, 0.6473376445286511, 4.605170185988091, 0.6699801212784109, 1.0453677741492975, 4.605170185988091, 2.2129729343043585, 0.9202046311952914, 0.3522205935893521, 0.5412311385341033], [1.4508328822574619, 1.3555227024531369, 4.605170185988091, 0.06464538859738127, 2.6548056865833978, 3.7534179752515073, 2.367123614131617, 0.02771770879636921, 0.22705745063534608, 2.367123614131617]], "target_roberta_idx": [45, 46, 47, 56, 74, 96, 107, 114, 160, 163], "target_prob_idx": [43, 44, 45, 54, 72, 92, 103, 110, 155, 158]}

Despite this, bees are able to fly because they have evolved a number of adaptations that allow them to do so.", "label": "Llama-2-13b-chat-hf", "label_int": 3, "est_prob_list": [[4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 3.912022829055786, 2.6592600345611572, 3.5065577030181885, 3.5065579414367676, 2.8103432208299637], [2.995732307434082, 2.995732307434082, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 2.8409669597943625, 2.3025851249694824, 2.4079456329345703, 2.4079456329345703, 3.912022829055786, 2.5462637543678284], [0.23572230339050293, 0.17431310364054625, 1.643042266368866, 1.0788096189498901, 0.0, 0.46809222688168367, 0.10986614649967208, 0.04458053811946123, 0.0, 0.2231435328722], [2.207274913787842, 2.207274913787842, 2.510342836380005, 1.5141277313232422, 0.4004775285720825, 2.4887442141771317, 1.091040313243866, 0.3285040259361267, 0.0, 0.9162907004356384], [4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 0.5980022847652435, 0.17435342073440552, 0.010050326585769653, 2.750888952612877, 0.3326449121038119, 0.13926206529140472, 0.0, 0.5798184871673584], [3.147282171681192, 1.5021261766450122, 2.9802280870180256, 2.8371272433773522, 1.0792693258249788, 2.111190239994416, 2.0794415416798357, 1.3555227024531369, 0.7660539513680331, 0.19331931100349597], [1.556193397915288, 3.242592351485517, 4.1588830833596715, 4.605170185988091, 1.1384581972153094, 0.7915872533731978, 2.2870809064580806, 1.8562979903656263, 1.1384581972153094, 0.24686007793152578]], "target_roberta_idx": [31, 32, 34, 37, 38, 41, 69, 81, 86, 108], "target_prob_idx": [29, 30, 32, 35, 36, 39, 67, 79, 84, 106]}

Etymologically speaking, for example, ambidextrous derives from Latin (I think it's Latin) for \"both right (hands)\", while other words like \"sinister\" and \"gauche\" (gauche in this case meaning 'other', or 'classless') both come from words that meant \"left\".", "label": "human", "label_int": 0, "est_prob_list": [[4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 3.6896599928538003, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091], [4.542612210274381, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 3.1547358582732286, 3.597696493046231, 4.372886718350978, 4.605170185988091, 3.121446669101715, 3.9536318268628303], [4.605170185988091, 0.21396323481045884, 2.4601697264374383, 0.7765287756919861, 1.129148861913941, 3.4662737148435534, 4.605170185988091, 0.012477784988254095, 2.1721734181046486, 1.2039728164672852], [4.605170185988091, 1.9857235446887789, 4.605170185988091, 1.2378742694854736, 0.4479856648559909, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 0.0, 4.29034329294639, 0.22816870361566544], [4.605170185988091, 1.0216511487960815, 2.6592600345611572, 0.9979716596770755, 1.326201422742413, 3.1840868532873907, 4.605170185988091, 0.0, 1.515327695318627, 1.5542306375163781], [1.4343035803062512, 3.242592351485517, 4.605170185988091, 4.1588830833596715, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 2.2493405784752336], [1.7165360479904674, 3.242592351485517, 4.605170185988091, 3.242592351485517, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 2.4541349911212467]], "target_roberta_idx": [38, 72, 117, 132, 155, 163, 167, 171, 172, 175], "target_prob_idx": [34, 65, 97, 109, 132, 137, 141, 144, 145, 148]}

{"text": "Yes, there has been scientific research conducted on the likelihood of intelligent life existing elsewhere in the universe. This field of study is known as astrobiology or the search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI). One of the most famous scientific endeavors in this area is the Drake Equation, proposed by astrophysicist Frank Drake in 1961. The equation attempts to estimate the number of active, communicative extraterrestrial civilizations in the Milky Way galaxy by considering factors such as the rate of star formation, the fraction of stars with planets, the number of habitable planets per star, and the probability of life developing on those planets. Although the Drake Equation is based on many assumptions and uncertainties, it has sparked further research and discussions on the topic.

{"text": "World outdoor triple jump record holder and BBC pundit Jonathan Edwards believes Phillips Idowu can take gold at the European Indoor Championships. Idowu landed 17.30m at the British trials in Sheffield last month to lead the world triple jump rankings. \"It's all down to him, but if he jumps as well as he did in Sheffield he could win the gold medal,\" said Edwards. \"His ability is undoubted but all his best performances seem to happen in domestic meetings.\" Idowu made his breakthrough five years ago but so far has only a Commonwealth silver medal to his name. Edwards himself kept Idowu off top spot at the Manchester Games. But he believes the European Indoors in Madrid represent a chance for the 26-year-old to prove his credentials as Britain's top triple jumper. \"He has to start producing at international level and here is the beginning,\" said Edwards. \"Phillips still needs to be much more consistent. I'm sure a victory in Madrid will build up his confidence and self-belief that he can be best in the world.\" The qualifying round of the men's triple jump in Madrid takes place on Friday with the final scheduled for Saturday.

{"text": "British athletics legend, Jonathan Edwards, has tipped Phillips Idowu for European gold in the triple jump event. Idowu, who has been in excellent form this season, is set to compete in the upcoming European Athletics Championships in Paris. Speaking to BBC Sport, Edwards praised Idowu's skill and consistency in recent competitions. He highlighted Idowu's impressive performance at the Diamond League meeting in Monaco, where he jumped a season's best distance of 17.23m to secure victory. The former Olympic champion also commended Idowu's mental strength and determination, noting that he has overcome numerous challenges throughout his career. Edwards believes that this resilience will serve him well in the highly competitive field of the European Championships. Idowu, a former world champion and Olympic silver medalist, has a wealth of experience to draw upon. However, he faces stiff competition from reigning European champion, Pedro Pablo Pichardo of Portugal, and other talented athletes in the triple jump event. Idowu, known for his flamboyant style and showmanship, has been working hard to fine-tune his technique and regain his best form. With Edwards' endorsement and his own determination, he will be aiming to add another major title to his already impressive collection.

{"text": "In a remarkable show of confidence, former triple jump champion Jonathan Edwards has tipped fellow Briton Phillips Idowu to clinch the gold medal at the upcoming European Athletics Championships. Edwards, who has held the world record since 1995, believes Idowu possesses the talent and experience to dominate the field. Idowu, the reigning Olympic silver medalist, has been in impressive form this season, consistently delivering jumps that have kept him at the top of the European rankings. His recent performance at the Diamond League meeting in Rome, where he secured a jump of 17.41 meters, has further cemented his position as the favorite for the European title. Edwards, who retired from athletics in 2003, has been closely following Idowu's career and feels that the London-born athlete has grown tremendously over the years, both technically and mentally. \"Phillips has shown great consistency this season, and I believe he's ready to take his performance to the next level. His experience at major championships could give him the edge over the competition,\" Edwards said.

{"text": "Liverpool and Millwall have been charged by the Football Association over crowd trouble during their Carling Cup match on 26 October. Millwall, who lost the match 3-0, have also been charged over alleged racist behaviour by their supporters. During the match at Millwall's new Den Stadium, seats were ripped up and four people were ejected from the ground. A disabled fan was injured at the perimeter of the pitch and riot police were needed to control the situation. Liverpool fans claimed the trouble was sparked by chants about the Hillsborough disaster, where 96 supporters were crushed to death in April 1989. But Lions chairman Theo Paphitis has denied the claims. He has said CCTV footage showed the catalyst for the trouble was a Liverpool fan attacking a Millwall fan in the west stand. However, Millwall have been charged with two breaches of FA rules. They have been charged with failing to ensure that fans refrained from racist and/or abusive behaviour and for failing to prevent spectators throwing missiles onto the pitch. Liverpool have been charged with one breach for failing to prevent their fans conducting themselves in threatening and/or violent and/or provocative behaviour.

The charge is in relation to an incident involving Steven Gerrard, who was sent off after being shown two yellow cards within three minutes of each other at Anfield on Saturday.

In both cases, there were no red or cautionary cards issued but the FA decided to take action because it felt they had not been dealt with properly.

{"text": "The Football Association (FA) has charged both Liverpool and Millwall following an incident during their recent FA Cup match. The charges come after investigations were carried out into alleged misconduct by players and staff from both teams. The incident in question occurred during the 78th minute of the match when a heated exchange between players from both sides escalated into a physical altercation. Video footage captured players from both teams pushing and shoving each other, with some exchanging heated words. After a thorough review of the footage and statements from officials and players, the FA has decided to charge both Liverpool and Millwall with failing to control their players. This charge carries a potential fine and potential disciplinary action against individuals involved.

The charges come after a review of the match footage and reports from match officials. Liverpool is facing repercussions for the behavior of their fans during the away fixture against Manchester United. Allegations of offensive chanting and the use of pyrotechnics have prompted the FA to take action. The club has been given a deadline to respond to the charges, and could face fines or potentially more severe sanctions if found guilty. Millwall, on the other hand, has been charged after their supporters encroached onto the pitch following their team's late winner in a home game against local rivals. The scenes at The Den raised safety concerns, with fans and players intermingling in a manner that contravenes league rules on fan conduct. Millwall has also been given a deadline to provide their response to the FA's charge.

Biden has been involved in politics for over four decades, serving as a U.S. Senator from Delaware for 36 years and as Vice President under President Barack Obama. Throughout his career, Biden has often positioned himself as a moderate Democrat, emphasizing his ability to work across the aisle and find common ground with Republicans.

Jones, who won five medals at the 2000 Olympics, denies using drugs and says she will take legal action over Conte's allegations.

He tested positive for cocaine and norco - both banned substances under World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) rules. His coach John Boulter told BBC Sport it would have been impossible for him not to take any medication during training because of injuries suffered while competing.

{"text": "BBC News Editor, The public outcry over the doping scandal involving Team Sky and its leader, Chris Froome, has been so great that the International Cycling Union (UCI) has announced that the medals awarded to the Team Sky riders should be taken away if they are found guilty. This announcement follows the admission by Team Sky that some of its riders had used illegal performance enhancing drugs, including the banned substance, Salbutamol. The UCI's decision has been met with approval by many in the cycling community.

Jones, a celebrated athlete in the world of track and field, has been accused of using performance-enhancing substances to gain an unfair advantage in her competitions. The allegations against Jones surfaced after an anonymous source leaked documents to the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA), which reportedly contain evidence of her involvement in the use of banned substances. WADA has since launched an investigation into the matter. If these allegations are proven to be true, it would be a major blow to the integrity of the sport and the Olympic movement as a whole.

{"text": "The most important source for getting information about current events in our society is television (TV). It has become a part of everyday life because it provides us with entertainment as well as useful knowledge. The main advantage of watching TV programs is that we are able to see what's happening around the world at any time. We also learn how people live their lives through these shows. However, there are some disadvantages too. For example, sometimes we don't know whether or not something really happened until after the program airs. Also, many times when we watch TV programs, we only hear one side of an argument. This means that we miss out on hearing both sides of the story. Another problem is that if someone wants to make money by selling products they have no interest in, then this person will try to convince us to buy them. In addition, commercials interrupt the flow of the show so much that we lose track of where we were before the commercial break began. Finally, since TV programs are usually made for profit rather than education, they often contain inaccurate facts and biased opinions. Therefore, I believe that although watching TV may be entertaining, it isn't always reliable. On the other hand, newspapers provide more accurate information but aren't nearly as interesting. They tend to focus mainly on local issues while ignoring international ones. Newspapers also take longer to read compared to TV programs. So, I would say that reading newspaper articles is better than watching TV.

{"text": "In my opinion, the best medium to get news is the Internet. With the advent of technology and the widespread use of smartphones and computers, the internet has become an indispensable source of information for people around the world. Firstly, the internet provides a vast array of news sources, allowing users to access a diverse range of perspectives and opinions. Traditional news outlets such as BBC, CNN, and Al Jazeera, as well as online news websites and blogs, offer up-to-date coverage of local and global events. This allows users to get a well-rounded view of current affairs, without relying on a single source. Secondly, the internet offers a level of interactivity that is not possible with traditional media. Online news platforms allow users to engage with the content through comments sections, social media, and online forums. This enables a two-way conversation between the news outlet and the audience, allowing for a more dynamic and inclusive news experience. Furthermore, the internet allows for real-time updates and breaking news alerts, keeping users informed of developing stories as they unfold. This is particularly useful for major events such as natural disasters, political elections, and global conflicts, where timely information is crucial. Finally, the internet is accessible from anywhere with an internet connection, making it an ideal medium for people who are always on-the-go. This is particularly useful for those who may not have access to traditional news sources, such as those living in remote areas or those with limited mobility.", "label": "Llama-2-13b-chat-hf", "label_int": 3, "est_prob_list": [[4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091], [4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 3.5065579414367676, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 1.8325814008712769, 3.912022829055786, 3.912022829055786], [1.868263378739357, 0.0, 0.27285050672113564, 0.0, 0.06351657770498485, 0.5621189475059509, 0.42063020113941946, 0.1635420247912407, 0.010050326585769653, 0.010050326585769653], [1.9357873931527139, 0.0, 0.785392028944833, 0.0, 1.5141276121139526, 1.5141276121139526, 1.5141276121139526, 1.8969500809907913, 0.6348783373832703, 0.6348783373832703], [1.8269790798425674, 0.0, 0.37178594725472586, 0.0, 0.47803568840026855, 0.47803568840026855, 0.47803568840026855, 0.27675150567665696, 0.5108255743980408, 0.5108255743980408], [4.605170185988091, 2.772588722239781, 2.0794415416798357, 0.514739523087127, 0.0813456394539524, 0.4514272436728001, 2.4096832285504126, 0.8817383503674954, 0.40351388797690263, 0.31406882762497584], [4.1588830833596715, 0.44531101665536404, 2.4541349911212467, 1.0233888674305223, 0.13353139262452263, 0.3746934494414107, 0.808978996085067, 0.1980699137620938, 0.7744928200138977, 0.1158318155251217]], "target_roberta_idx": [22, 26, 54, 65, 75, 77, 78, 153, 220, 221], "target_prob_idx": [21, 25, 53, 64, 74, 76, 77, 145, 208, 209]}

The Internet offers a wide range of news sources, allowing individuals to access a diverse range of perspectives and opinions. This means that people can make informed decisions based on a variety of different viewpoints. Additionally, the Internet allows individuals to access news from anywhere in the world, making it a valuable resource for staying up-to-date on global events. Furthermore, the Internet allows individuals to access news in real-time, meaning that they can stay informed about breaking events as they happen. This is particularly important in today's fast-paced world, where news can change quickly and unexpectedly. While television and radio can also be valuable sources of news, they are often limited in terms of the depth and breadth of coverage that they can provide. Additionally, these mediums are often subject to bias and can be influenced by commercial interests, which can affect the accuracy and reliability of the information presented.

{"text": "In today's fast-paced world, staying informed about current events is crucial. With the advent of technology, there are various mediums available to access news, including radio, television, and the internet. While each medium has its own advantages, I believe that the internet is the best source to get up-to-date news. Firstly, the internet offers a vast array of news sources from around the world. Unlike traditional media, which is often limited by time constraints or geographical boundaries, the internet provides access to a multitude of news outlets with diverse perspectives. This allows individuals to gather information from different sources and form a more comprehensive understanding of global events. Secondly, the internet provides real-time updates on breaking news. Unlike radio or television, which may have scheduled news bulletins, the internet continuously updates news articles and videos as events unfold. This ensures that individuals can stay informed about the latest developments as they happen, enabling them to respond promptly and make informed decisions. Furthermore, the internet allows for personalized news consumption. With the rise of social media platforms and news aggregators, individuals can customize their news feed to include topics and sources that align with their interests. This personalized approach ensures that individuals receive news that is relevant to them, enhancing their overall news consumption experience. Moreover, the internet facilitates interactive engagement with the news. Through comment sections and social media platforms, individuals can actively participate in discussions surrounding news articles.

{"text": "In the contemporary era of information technology, the means by which we access news has diversified significantly. Radio, television, and the internet each serve as conduits for current events and updates, yet they offer distinct experiences. In my view, the internet stands out as the superior medium for accessing news due to its convenience, immediacy, and the breadth of content available. Firstly, the internet provides unparalleled convenience. Unlike radio or television, which operate on schedules and require a listener or viewer to be available at specific times, the internet allows for on-demand access to news. Users can easily search for and consume news at any time and place, provided they have an internet connection. This flexibility is especially beneficial for people with busy schedules or those living in different time zones from where the news originates. Secondly, the immediacy of the internet is unmatched. While radio and television can offer timely broadcasts, the internet delivers real-time updates, often from multiple sources simultaneously. During critical events, such as natural disasters or political upheavals, the internet becomes an invaluable tool for the latest information. Live blogs, streaming services, and social media platforms provide instantaneous reporting that is not constrained by programming schedules or geographic boundaries. Finally, the breadth and depth of news available on the internet exceed what is typically offered by radio and television. Online, one can access not only local and national news but also international coverage that might not be available through other media. Additionally, the internet caters to a diverse range of interests, providing specialized news sites, expert blogs, and forums for niche topics.", "label": "gpt-4-1106-preview", "label_int": 7, "est_prob_list": [[4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 3.5065579414367676], [4.605170185988091, 4.134336403438023, 3.2188756465911865, 2.5682032704353333, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 3.392162472009659, 3.912022829055786, 4.605170185988091, 3.2188758850097656], [4.605170185988091, 4.352751610534532, 2.209284464518229, 1.504052072763443, 3.5065579414367676, 3.5065579414367676, 4.605170185988091, 2.5, 1.0761406467511103, 1.8116846332947414], [4.605170185988091, 2.1055524157626286, 1.093264667938153, 0.5420191586017609, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 2.505025163292885, 1.4042476507333608, 4.605170185988091], [4.605170185988091, 4.439778557845524, 1.6905532677968342, 0.39304956048727036, 3.9120230674743652, 3.9120230674743652, 4.605170185988091, 2.5, 1.2132888642641215, 1.9258814652760823], [3.242592351485517, 4.605170185988091, 4.446565155811453, 0.07290677080808779, 2.600738465313122, 0.9104484562499267, 0.5412311385341033, 1.1384581972153094, 0.26197371574157396, 1.2411123512753928], [2.9808533963502652, 4.605170185988091, 0.8752215905789178, 0.22002650172620167, 1.556193397915288, 0.808978996085067, 0.6159549005799746, 0.44531101665536404, 0.808978996085067, 1.0002238452854095]], "target_roberta_idx": [26, 34, 107, 132, 253, 254, 275, 276, 279, 313], "target_prob_idx": [24, 31, 103, 126, 241, 242, 263, 264, 267, 300]}

{"text": "The term \"progressive\" refers to a style of music that has been influenced by both heavy metal and jazz. The term \"hardcore\" refers to a style of music that was heavily influenced by punk rock and hard-rock bands such as Black Sabbath, Judas Priest, Metallica, and Iron Maiden. The term \"metal\" refers to a genre of music that combines elements from all three styles. Progressive rock is often considered to be more aggressive than other genres of music because it tends to have a slower tempo and heavier guitar tone. Hardcore is usually considered to be more melodic than other genres of music because it tends to have faster tempos and lighter guitars.", "label": "gpt2-xl", "label_int": 1, "est_prob_list": [[4.605170185988091, 3.040361022949219, 3.7092905044555664, 2.6592600345611572, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 2.9542340278625487, 3.2188758850097656, 3.2188758850097656, 2.6592600345611572], [4.605170185988091, 3.4718848705291747, 2.525728464126587, 2.525728464126587, 3.5065579414367676, 3.5065579414367676, 3.5112897157669067, 2.995732069015503, 2.995732069015503, 2.407945394515991], [4.605170185988091, 4.006030195951462, 4.605170185988091, 0.0, 1.5526168296734493, 2.3025851249694824, 0.13926199078559875, 2.6592600345611572, 4.494445025920868, 2.995732307434082], [4.605170185988091, 4.0835572391748425, 4.605170185988091, 0.0, 1.0763256633654237, 1.6094378232955933, 0.7765287160873413, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 2.407945394515991], [4.605170185988091, 4.006030195951462, 4.605170185988091, 0.0, 0.90485278579096, 1.3470736742019653, 0.05129324272274971, 3.5065579414367676, 4.605170185988091, 1.8971199989318848], [0.4700036292457356, 1.881615798349916, 0.29815337231907635, 2.4096832285504126, 2.048669883013082, 1.5021261766450122, 4.605170185988091, 0.24686007793152578, 0.48258241145259567, 0.5753641449035618], [1.6331544390514163, 3.0602707946915624, 0.5212969236332861, 2.367123614131617, 1.807507826196194, 1.8562979903656263, 4.605170185988091, 1.1384581972153094, 1.2966822024302034, 1.1631508098056809]], "target_roberta_idx": [32, 33, 42, 86, 94, 95, 113, 115, 116, 132], "target_prob_idx": [29, 30, 39, 79, 87, 88, 106, 108, 109, 123]}

Progressive Rock, often shortened to \"prog rock,\" originated in the late 1960s and early 1970s. It is characterized by its ambitious, sometimes pretentious efforts to elevate rock music to new levels of artistic credibility. Prog rock bands are known for their complex song structures, unusual time signatures, and incorporation of elements from classical, jazz, and world music.

In fact, many people have tried to create one over the past few centuries. However, none of these attempts were successful because they didn't take into account the complexity of human thought. In this article I will explain why we can never build an AI that could ever be considered as intelligent as humans. This is because there are two main reasons why we cannot achieve such a feat. First, we don't know how to program an AI to think like us. Second, we do not yet fully understand what makes us human. What Is An Artificial Intelligence?

The most advanced AI systems are now capable of doing many tasks better than the best people in those fields.

This includes playing chess against grandmasters, winning at Go (a game similar to Chess), defeating world champions at Jeopardy!, etc. In fact, they beat all three of these games' top players simultaneously! The reason why this question is so controversial is because there are two different types of AIs out there today - one type is called an Artificial General Intelligence or AGI while another type is called an Artificial Narrow Intelligence or ANI. Both are very powerful and both will eventually replace us as the dominant species on Earth. However, only the AGI's will become truly sentient beings with free will.

Some argue that a true AI, characterized by human-like intelligence and consciousness, has not yet been created. Others argue that AI systems with a degree of intelligence and autonomy do exist, and that these systems are becoming more advanced and sophisticated over time. One argument against the existence of a true AI is that current AI systems are based on algorithms and programming, which are fundamentally different from the human brain and its processes. Additionally, AI systems lack the ability to understand or experience emotions, which is a key aspect of human consciousness. On the other hand, proponents of AI argue that current AI systems do have a degree of intelligence and autonomy, and that they are becoming increasingly sophisticated. For example, AI systems can be trained to recognize patterns and make decisions based on data, and they can perform tasks that would be too complex for humans to perform.

The closest any machine has come to achieving true artificial intelligence is the passing of the Turing Test, which is an arbitrary benchmark and not a definitive measure of intelligence. In order to understand what true artificial intelligence would mean, it is important to understand what it would take for a machine to have a consciousness and understanding similar to a human.

{"text": "As of my last knowledge update in April 2023, a \"true artificial intelligence,\" often referred to as Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) or strong AI, does not yet exist. AGI would be an AI that possesses the ability to understand, learn, and apply its intelligence broadly across a range of domains, much like a human being. It would have the capacity for reasoning, problem-solving, abstract thinking, planning, and understanding complex ideas, potentially even possessing consciousness, self-awareness, and emotions. Current AI systems, including the most advanced machine learning models, are examples of Artificial Narrow Intelligence (ANI) or weak AI. These systems are highly specialized and operate within a limited predefined range or domain. They can perform specific tasks, sometimes surpassing human performance levels, such as playing chess, recognizing speech, translating languages, driving cars, and diagnosing diseases.

McLeish, whose tenure as the national team coach ended in 2019, has been involved in various roles within football, but his latest position has drawn some scepticism from fans and pundits alike. McLeish's role will involve offering strategic advice on the development of the game in Scotland, with an emphasis on nurturing young talent and improving the national team's performance. He will also be tasked with providing insights into coaching education and contributing to discussions on the future direction of Scottish football. Despite his vast experience, which includes managing clubs in the English Premier League and the Scottish Premiership, some critics argue that McLeish's recent record with the national team does not warrant a return to the SFA in such a significant capacity. In response to the concerns, McLeish has acknowledged that scrutiny comes with the territory in high-profile football positions.", "label": "gpt-4-1106-preview", "label_int": 7, "est_prob_list": [[3.912022829055786, 3.912022829055786, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091], [2.813410758972168, 2.813410758972168, 3.94728878566197, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 3.912022829055786, 3.218875765800476, 3.9883862137794495, 3.8440396785736084, 3.9434549311796823], [0.9416085481643677, 0.3622499704360962, 4.605170185988091, 2.407945394515991, 0.5558487176895142, 1.8894607722759247, 3.5065579414367676, 0.05766791797110012, 0.6733444333076477, 0.8966803550720215], [0.5798184871673584, 0.642169197400411, 4.605170185988091, 2.525728464126587, 0.9045544900000095, 1.530402423813939, 3.1599843502044678, 0.1867093529020037, 0.6539263725280762, 2.08669376373291], [0.8209805488586426, 0.49266286691029865, 4.605170185988091, 2.0402209758758545, 0.6621293965727091, 1.3449902385473251, 3.565449357032776, 0.09351939601557595, 0.4462871253490448, 1.3478138148784637], [0.639902666041133, 1.067840630001356, 2.9802280870180256, 0.07290677080808779, 0.5278976076646381, 4.605170185988091, 0.4637730794950995, 4.605170185988091, 0.0813456394539524, 4.605170185988091], [0.257069545652937, 2.5494451709255714, 2.318147550902355, 0.5721243742217186, 0.5341554833420418, 4.605170185988091, 0.6287122052570119, 4.605170185988091, 0.34117075740276714, 1.0073268589355728]], "target_roberta_idx": [37, 38, 76, 91, 125, 129, 130, 147, 149, 155], "target_prob_idx": [32, 33, 68, 83, 117, 121, 122, 139, 141, 145]}
{"text": "The diagram shows a demonstration of how essential oil is used in a perfumery manufacturing system to produce perfume. Overall, the given process consists of ten stages in the perfume production process, starting with the boiling of water and ending with the refined hydrolat. The production process of perfume begins with a water container being placed over a heat source using fire. The bubbling water then evaporates releasing hot steam which flows to the second container through a tube. At this point, the steam is used to increase the temperature of aromatic plants, letting the raw materials produce oil to trap the mixture of steam and oil vapor. Following this, the production process continues the vaporized oil flows through a coiling system the condenser where it's condensed. Simultaneously, both ends of the cell contain hot and cold water supplied by two different tubes. In the last step, water mixed with essential oil is then shifted to the separator where it's filtered out to produce the final product hydrolat.", "label": "human", "label_int": 0, "est_prob_list": [[4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 3.912022829055786, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091], [4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 2.167246376302684, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 2.3025851249694824, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091], [4.315575384875089, 0.7765286564826965, 4.605170185988091, 0.9416084885597229, 4.605170185988091, 1.6094378232955933, 1.5695372868488406, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 2.356887323515756], [4.085309684276581, 3.6560914933318287, 1.3724189784068102, 1.4271163940429688, 4.605170185988091, 0.9416084289550781, 0.31471070647239685, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.0115327316155645], [3.6496963395401543, 0.843970000743866, 2.9615857068999873, 0.8607525480309354, 4.605170185988091, 0.9162905812263489, 1.6146800885313621, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 3.1081422389757267], [4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.446565155811453, 4.605170185988091, 3.7534179752515073, 2.906120114864304, 1.4343035803062512, 3.9357395320454622], [4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 3.0602707946915624, 3.4657359027997265, 1.6739764335716716, 1.9616585060234524, 3.242592351485517]], "target_roberta_idx": [49, 57, 60, 86, 174, 176, 180, 190, 191, 192], "target_prob_idx": [46, 52, 55, 79, 162, 164, 168, 177, 178, 179]}
{"text": "Oil is used to produce perfumes because it has a high melting point (about 60\u00b0C) and low boiling point (about 40\u00b0C). It also contains many volatile components that are not present in other materials. The fragrance industry uses about 1 million barrels per year. In addition to its fragrant properties, oil can be used as an additive for making cosmetics, soaps or detergents. Oil is also used in the manufacture of plastics, rubber and paper products. There are two types of oil - synthetic and natural. Synthetic oils have been produced from petroleum sources such as coal tar, bitumen, shale gas and crude oil. Natural oils come from plants, trees, seaweed and sea water. They contain no carbon dioxide and therefore do not contribute to global warming. Synthetic oils are usually made up of different fatty acids, which are chemically linked together to form long chains called triglycerides. These chains are then broken down into smaller molecules called monoglycerides and diglycerides.", "label": "gpt2-xl", "label_int": 1, "est_prob_list": [[3.434637427330017, 3.9120230674743652, 3.9120230674743652, 4.205520987510681, 3.2856415510177612, 4.605170185988091, 2.813410758972168, 3.3103920459747314, 3.796175718307495, 3.912022829055786], [4.39429634809494, 2.995732307434082, 2.995732307434082, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 3.4490215301513674, 3.9120230674743652, 2.995732307434082], [0.010050326585769653, 2.083457589149475, 1.1711828708648682, 0.6878350575764974, 0.08338159322738647, 3.25084031952752, 2.995732307434082, 0.4462871253490448, 2.809294170034783, 2.669977347056071], [0.0, 4.605170185988091, 1.5141277313232422, 2.038405100504557, 0.2231435328722, 3.866971386803521, 2.207274913787842, 0.41551539301872253, 1.633253418973514, 2.0650298396746316], [0.0, 2.7863770723342896, 0.9675838947296143, 1.5094030300776164, 0.030459178611636162, 4.406085862053765, 1.6607311964035034, 0.9162906408309937, 2.5064588955470493, 2.45134045680364], [0.7493868988828214, 0.4637730794950995, 4.1588830833596715, 4.446565155811453, 0.2124586512141934, 3.7534179752515073, 4.605170185988091, 0.08985632912186105, 0.9500575943449725, 0.8356472431672284], [0.9602099658089905, 0.5345421503833068, 2.367123614131617, 4.605170185988091, 0.09844007281325252, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 0.38612214526503347, 1.5198257537444133, 1.9616585060234524]], "target_roberta_idx": [37, 58, 59, 72, 89, 115, 143, 169, 191, 193], "target_prob_idx": [32, 53, 54, 66, 80, 105, 131, 156, 177, 179]}
{"text": "Oil has been used for many years as a source of fuel to produce heat energy. It was first discovered in 1859 when it was found that crude oil could be burned without any smoke or soot being produced. This discovery led to an increase in demand for petroleum products such as petrol, diesel etc. The amount of oil available from underground deposits increased rapidly during the 20th century with new discoveries made all over the world. However, this rapid growth in supply did not keep pace with increasing demands because more efficient methods were developed which allowed people to live longer lives and drive cars further than ever before. As a result there are now concerns about whether we will have enough oil left to meet our needs into the future. There are three major problems associated with using fossil fuels like oil; they cause pollution, climate change and depletion of resources.

Firstly, the oil is extracted from plants such as roses, lavender, and jasmine. This is done through a process called distillation, which involves heating the plants and collecting the steam that is released. The steam is then condensed to form a liquid, which is the essential oil. It is worth noting that different plants produce different types of oil, each with its own unique scent. Secondly, the essential oil is mixed with alcohol to create the base of the perfume. This is done in a large container, where the oil and alcohol are carefully measured and then combined. The alcohol acts as a solvent, helping to dissolve the oil and distribute its fragrance evenly.

{"text": "Spending money in family celebrations can be seen as a way of appreciating where one comes from. Although some people say it is a total waste of money, l assert that it is wiser. To begin with, many people feel that it is of no importance to consume money on family gatherings. This is because people usually have more pressing issues in life like urgent health cases that require money. Also, some struggle to provide basic needs for their families, for example, tuitions, decent meals and shelter. For these reasons, it seems using money on family gatherings is just a luxury. Despite the merits of the arguments above, although many say it is wasteful to financially cater for family parties, l assert that it is crucial. One reason is that, it unites families and a sweet spirit is maintained if family members are recognised for their special days such as wedding anniversaries, birthdays and graduations where money is spent. Further, appreciation to others within the family cannot be expressed in many ways without forking out some money. Furthermore, money has to be spent on family get togethers where everyone is in a joyous mood so that people can catch up and release stresses from their straining personal lives. What is more, culture, closeness and love is easily displayed when families come together for such celebrations and use money for their own satisfaction. For instance, when my childhood birthdays were celebrated, l felt so much loved and l still cherish the memories as l vividly can recall. To conclude, although others feel that it is money consuming to fund family gatherings, l advocate that it is a wiser option. Should this be the case, love within families would not wax cold and family members would feel more appreciated.", "label": "human", "label_int": 0, "est_prob_list": [[4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091], [4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 3.9120230674743652, 3.9120230674743652], [4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 2.973425865546254, 4.605170185988091, 0.5720252270499865, 4.605170185988091, 0.2744368612766266, 4.605170185988091, 0.12693984946236014, 0.024266416224894304], [4.605170185988091, 3.474145599773952, 2.1281884435004543, 4.605170185988091, 0.27981900175412494, 3.184505808353424, 0.5315777015152731, 4.605170185988091, 0.3585268557071686, 0.0], [4.605170185988091, 2.994851674352373, 1.5293090119957924, 4.605170185988091, 0.27448201898283253, 4.605170185988091, 0.36513316866058554, 4.605170185988091, 0.16800597909297071, 0.010050326585769653], [4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 0.16528009093910292, 2.772588722239781, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 2.8371272433773522, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 3.147282171681192], [4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 0.44531101665536404, 1.8562979903656263, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 3.242592351485517, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 3.242592351485517]], "target_roberta_idx": [50, 64, 89, 200, 230, 268, 280, 325, 326, 327], "target_prob_idx": [47, 61, 86, 192, 219, 255, 266, 311, 312, 313]}
{"text": "Question 1: What do you think is the best way to celebrate a wedding? Answer: I would like to have a big party with lots of food, music, dancing, games etc. Question 2: How much does it cost to buy all the necessary things for a large celebration? Answer: It depends on how many guests are coming. If there are only two people who want to come then it will be cheaper than if there were 10 people. However, if there are more than ten people, then it will be more expensive. Question 3: Do you think it is better to spend money on buying gifts for your friends and relatives or spending money on yourself? Answer: Spending money on myself is always good because I can give something back to my family. But if they don't need anything, then it's not worth it. Question 4: Why do you think it is important to spend money on family celebrations? Answer: Because it makes us feel happy when we see our loved ones enjoying themselves. We also get to know them better and make new memories together. Question 5: Is it true that it is better to spend money on yourself rather than on gifts for your friends and relatives? Answer: Yes, it is. When you spend money on yourself, you will feel happier and more satisfied. You will also enjoy yourself more. Question 6: What do you think is the most important thing in life?

{"text": "My opinion is that spending too much time with our families can be harmful, because we are not able to do other things in life. Spending more than two hours per day at home will make us less productive during workdays. We need to have some free time so that we can relax after working hard all week long. I also agree with this view as I am very busy these days. My friends say they cannot find enough time to go out with their partners. They always want me to join them when they plan something fun. But I don't like going out alone; I prefer being with my partner. It makes me feel lonely if he goes somewhere without me. So I would rather stay at home instead of joining him. If you ask me why I love staying at home, I could tell you many good reasons. Firstly, I enjoy cooking food for myself and eating what I prepare. Secondly, I get to know how my husband likes his meals. Thirdly, I can read books and watch movies whenever I wish. Fourthly, I can take care of my house by cleaning up everything inside and outside. Fifthly, I can listen to music while doing household chores. Sixthly, I can play games online with my boyfriend. Seventhly, I can talk to him over Skype.

{"text": "In recent years, the debate over the appropriateness of spending a lot of money on family celebrations has gained significant attention. While some people believe that such expenditures are necessary to create lasting memories and strengthen family bonds, others argue that it is a waste of money that could be better spent elsewhere. In this essay, I will examine both perspectives and provide reasons for my stance. On the one hand, those who advocate for spending money on family celebrations argue that these events provide a unique opportunity to create lasting memories and bring family members closer together. For instance, a lavish wedding or a grand vacation can be an experience that the family will cherish for a lifetime, and it can serve as a catalyst for bonding and strengthening relationships. Furthermore, such celebrations can also be a way to honor and show appreciation for one's family, particularly in cultures where family is highly valued. On the other hand, those who believe that spending money on family celebrations is a waste of resources point out that such expenditures can be prohibitively expensive and may not provide a lasting benefit. For example, a lavish wedding or a destination vacation may leave the family with a significant amount of debt, which can be a financial burden for years to come. Moreover, some argue that there are more meaningful ways to celebrate special occasions, such as hosting a potluck dinner or planning a free outdoor activity. In my opinion, the decision to spend money on family celebrations should be based on one's financial situation and priorities.

{"text": "In recent times, there has been a growing debate about the necessity of spending a considerable amount of money on family celebrations. Some people believe that it is crucial to allocate a significant portion of their budget towards these events, while others argue that it is a waste of hard-earned cash. In this essay, I will examine both viewpoints and provide reasons to support my stance. On the one hand, proponents of spending money on family celebrations argue that these occasions bring people closer together and create lasting memories. For instance, weddings, birthdays, and anniversaries are events that are cherished for a lifetime, and it is reasonable to invest in them to make them memorable. Moreover, these celebrations provide an opportunity for families to come together and strengthen their bonds, which is invaluable. On the other hand, opponents of lavish spending on family celebrations argue that it is a waste of money that could be used for more practical purposes. For example, the cost of a wedding could be better spent on a down payment for a house or putting it towards a child's education. Additionally, they argue that the pressure to have an expensive celebration can lead to financial strain and even debt. In my opinion, it is essential to strike a balance between spending money on family celebrations and being frugal. While it is understandable that these events can be costly, it is possible to have a memorable celebration without breaking the bank. For example, one could prioritize spending on the essentials, such as the venue and the food, and cut back on less important aspects, such as decorations or entertainment.

{"text": "Family celebrations are an integral part of our lives, and people have varying opinions on the amount of money that should be spent on them. While some individuals believe that it is important to splurge on family celebrations, others argue that it is a waste of money. This essay will discuss both perspectives. On one hand, there are those who believe that spending a significant amount of money on family celebrations is crucial. They argue that such celebrations provide an opportunity for families to bond and strengthen their relationships. By organizing lavish parties or gatherings, families can create lasting memories and demonstrate their love and affection for one another. Moreover, spending money on these celebrations can be seen as a way of showing appreciation and gratitude towards family members. It allows individuals to express their love and care through gifts or special treats, thereby fostering a sense of happiness and togetherness. On the other hand, there are individuals who consider spending a lot of money on family celebrations as a waste. They argue that excessive spending on such events can put financial strain on families. Money spent on expensive gifts or extravagant parties could be used for more practical purposes, such as education, healthcare, or savings. Furthermore, the pressure to spend a large sum of money on family celebrations can lead to unnecessary stress and anxiety. In this view, the emphasis should be on the quality of time spent together rather than the amount of money spent. In my opinion, striking a balance between the two perspectives is crucial. While it is important to celebrate and cherish our familial relationships, it should not be at the expense of financial stability.

{"text": "Family celebrations are pivotal moments that bring relatives together to share joy and create lasting memories. Some individuals advocate for lavish spending to mark these occasions, while others consider it an unnecessary extravagance. This essay will explore both perspectives before providing a personal viewpoint. On the one hand, proponents of grand family celebrations argue that these events are rare and thus deserve special attention and resources. They believe that the investment is not merely in the event itself but in the happiness and unity it fosters among family members. For example, milestone events such as weddings, anniversaries, or significant birthdays can be once-in-a-lifetime occasions, and spending substantially is viewed as a way to honor the individuals involved. Additionally, in some cultures, the scale of the celebration is seen as a reflection of family status and can be intertwined with cultural or societal expectations. However, there are compelling reasons to support the idea that excessive spending on family celebrations is unnecessary. Critics argue that the essence of these gatherings is togetherness and not the opulence of the event. They suggest that exorbitant costs can lead to financial strain, overshadowing the true purpose of the celebration. For instance, families may fall into debt to host an extravagant wedding, which could put undue pressure on the newlyweds. Moreover, simple yet meaningful celebrations can be equally effective in creating cherished memories. A modest family reunion in a home setting, where everyone contributes a dish or a story, can be just as significant and less financially burdensome.

Other arguments for saying 9/11 was not a conspiracy include the fact that the attacks were too complex to have been planned by a large group of people, and that the amount of secrecy required would have been impossible to maintain.", "label": "alpaca-7b", "label_int": 5, "est_prob_list": [[3.912022829055786, 3.9120230674743652, 3.9120230674743652, 3.9120230674743652, 3.6520928740501404, 3.5592500954452486, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091], [3.9120230674743652, 1.4271163940429688, 1.4271163940429688, 1.4271163940429688, 4.207913517951965, 2.2785405862248607, 2.495416224002838, 4.25859659910202, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091], [3.2188758850097656, 2.522844383958727, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 2.1272565871477127, 2.401760048336453, 0.09587503597140312, 1.0601317882537842, 2.1202635765075684, 1.215886469398226], [0.6931471824645996, 0.4329759692773223, 1.6094378232955933, 0.20377914445279946, 0.9859217554330826, 0.8930570946799384, 0.04057112135988556, 0.03509750903833671, 1.1410580047696548, 0.986642640213063], [1.5141277313232422, 2.5151520152576268, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 1.5505464226007462, 2.4766686227586536, 0.05442801117897034, 1.6094379425048828, 3.2188758850097656, 1.9090086072683334], [0.415278729556489, 2.6548056865833978, 4.605170185988091, 0.24686007793152578, 0.5212969236332861, 4.446565155811453, 1.807507826196194, 0.04391923393483549, 1.3256697393034558, 1.1263368366829645], [0.7915872533731978, 2.1439800628174073, 4.605170185988091, 0.5345421503833068, 1.7165360479904674, 4.605170185988091, 2.5494451709255714, 0.2369097470783577, 2.906120114864304, 2.772588722239781]], "target_roberta_idx": [34, 50, 51, 52, 76, 95, 107, 108, 109, 110], "target_prob_idx": [29, 43, 44, 45, 69, 86, 96, 97, 98, 99]}

One effective way to cope with these emotions is through self-forgiveness. Acknowledge your mistakes, but also recognize that you are human and deserving of compassion. Embrace the power of forgiveness and let go of self-blame. Another helpful approach is to focus on personal growth and make amends. Use past experiences as lessons for personal development rather than dwelling on them with regret. Take proactive steps towards repairing any relationships or situations that may still be causing guilt. Take responsibility for your actions and, if necessary, seek forgiveness from others.

It can be helpful to remind oneself that they are not defined by their past actions, and that they can learn from their mistakes and make different choices moving forward. Another way to cope with guilt and regret is to seek support from others.

Older adults can be guided to understand that everyone makes mistakes and that it's a part of being human. 2. **Therapy and counseling**: Professional help from a therapist or counselor can provide a safe space for older adults to express their feelings and work through their emotions. 3. **Life review and reminiscence**: Engaging in life review can help older adults reflect on their life experiences, acknowledge their accomplishments, and find meaning in their past actions. 4. **Social support**: Strengthening connections with family, friends, and community can provide emotional support and reduce feelings of isolation. 5.", "label": "gpt-4-1106-preview", "label_int": 7, "est_prob_list": [[4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 3.912022829055786, 4.17195326089859, 3.2188758850097656], [2.433105786641439, 4.605170185988091, 3.5159930363297462, 3.4538776874542236, 2.760730564594269, 4.605170185988091, 3.8068562773140995, 2.4079456329345703, 4.605170185988091, 2.995732307434082], [0.0067002177238464355, 2.351862836967815, 0.70640429854393, 4.605170185988091, 0.0, 0.2690310137612479, 1.4360070770437068, 0.12783338129520416, 1.0962875075638294, 0.0], [0.0, 3.6278468587181787, 3.7548708617687225, 4.605170185988091, 0.0, 0.4077475070953369, 1.2725875973701477, 0.6348782181739807, 3.152406267821789, 0.0], [0.013468458006779352, 2.3846294825727288, 2.5418633073568344, 4.605170185988091, 0.0, 0.14232470308031356, 1.2224645831368186, 0.07257068157196045, 1.4497348293662071, 0.010050326585769653], [2.048669883013082, 3.7534179752515073, 0.514739523087127, 4.605170185988091, 0.3087354816496133, 1.0908301482260547, 2.9802280870180256, 1.5198257537444133, 0.5212969236332861, 4.605170185988091], [2.772588722239781, 1.7055798509469482, 0.7248958788745256, 2.2893310736949553, 0.1980699137620938, 1.7165360479904674, 0.9687693421600426, 0.07573553801347897, 1.067840630001356, 4.605170185988091]], "target_roberta_idx": [38, 47, 65, 80, 84, 105, 149, 179, 185, 189], "target_prob_idx": [34, 43, 57, 73, 76, 98, 140, 170, 176, 180]}

Looking into details, first, raw water, which is the main ingredient, passes through a filter via a tube and flows through a room where water softener and chemicals are added. The liquid is then pumped into a device with electric heaters for the evaporation and carbonation process. In order to lower the tempurature, the heated water travels through a cooling pipe to another container to mix with carbon dioxide. Moving on to the next stage, a pipe connects the carbonated water from the second stage to a mixing tank. Here, colourings, syrup and flavour are added according to the designated look and taste of the final product. After that, the mixture passes through another filter before filling into containers. Lastly, the bottles and cans are then packed into packaging and delivered to stores, ready to be sold to consumers.", "label": "human", "label_int": 0, "est_prob_list": [[4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091], [4.386372859610655, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 3.912022829055786, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 2.9052147269248962], [4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 3.9120230674743652, 2.5132789171757843, 4.605170185988091, 2.5577102342536224, 3.2188758850097656], [4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 3.0411155777318135, 3.7769148727420356, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091], [4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 3.961149886218496, 4.605170185988091], [2.111190239994416, 0.3633938941874773, 2.600738465313122, 2.2129729343043585, 4.605170185988091, 0.6251965186514375, 0.10275973395776894, 0.7915872533731978, 4.605170185988091, 3.5992672954242493], [2.772588722239781, 1.2966822024302034, 3.7534179752515073, 3.7534179752515073, 4.605170185988091, 0.808978996085067, 0.7411563997463059, 1.4508328822574619, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091]], "target_roberta_idx": [40, 41, 42, 55, 60, 72, 102, 128, 167, 168], "target_prob_idx": [37, 38, 39, 52, 57, 68, 92, 117, 155, 156]}

{"text": "In order to understand how a drink is made we need first to know what it consists of. The ingredients are water, sugar (or honey), flavouring agents such as fruit juice or syrup, colouring matter like caramel, and carbon dioxide gas which makes up most of the volume of the finished product. When these components come together they react with each other producing bubbles that give the drink its characteristic fizzy taste. In addition, some people may add salt to their drinks for flavour purposes. Carbonation occurs when dissolved gases combine with liquid at high temperatures and pressures. Carbon dioxide dissolves more easily than oxygen so if you put air into your drink then this will dissolve faster and cause the drink to bubble. This means that the pressure inside the bottle increases until eventually there is enough force to burst through the container wall and create an explosion.", "label": "gpt-j-6b", "label_int": 2, "est_prob_list": [[4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091], [2.838506817817688, 2.995732069015503, 3.5065579414367676, 2.441976057158576, 4.605170185988091, 3.9120230674743652, 3.9120230674743652, 3.2188756465911865, 3.2188756465911865, 3.0693763494491577], [2.995732069015503, 0.6161860823631287, 0.10269133187830448, 0.5715994437535604, 0.3424902558326721, 0.025382648843030136, 1.6607310771942139, 2.2301456689834596, 4.605170185988091, 1.959089023726327], [2.407945394515991, 4.605170185988091, 0.4303348143585026, 3.346870746049616, 4.605170185988091, 0.04954809136688709, 4.605170185988091, 2.2408840656280518, 4.605170185988091, 3.4022158214024136], [3.2188756465911865, 3.2188758850097656, 0.2684418223798275, 1.3040076891581218, 0.843970000743866, 0.04082195460796356, 2.813410758972168, 1.1950262546539308, 4.605170185988091, 2.1606920106070384], [4.446565155811453, 4.605170185988091, 2.906120114864304, 0.6699801212784109, 3.9357395320454622, 1.282497567438247, 0.10275973395776894, 0.1980699137620938, 0.32482161940123766, 2.6548056865833978], [2.5494451709255714, 3.242592351485517, 2.906120114864304, 0.6623755218931916, 3.4657359027997265, 2.367123614131617, 0.5345421503833068, 0.38612214526503347, 0.3087354816496133, 1.9075912847531766]], "target_roberta_idx": [50, 56, 87, 112, 114, 119, 154, 156, 157, 159], "target_prob_idx": [48, 54, 84, 108, 110, 114, 149, 151, 152, 154]}

The ingredients are mixed in a large tank to create a syrup. 2. Carbonation: The syrup is then pumped into a carbonation tank where carbon dioxide gas is added under pressure. This process creates a fizzy or bubbly texture and gives the drink its characteristic taste. 3. Filling: The carbonated syrup is then filled into bottles or cans through a filling machine. The bottles or cans are cleaned and sanitized before filling to ensure hygiene and quality. 4. Sealing: After filling, the bottles or cans are sealed to prevent spillage and spoilage. The sealing process also helps to maintain the carbonation in the drink. 5.", "label": "Llama-2-13b-chat-hf", "label_int": 3, "est_prob_list": [[4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 3.9120230674743652, 3.9120230674743652, 2.7863770127296448, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 3.9120230674743652], [4.605170185988091, 3.2188758850097656, 3.5065579414367676, 1.309333324432373, 3.2188756465911865, 2.9923441410064697, 3.912022829055786, 3.912022829055786, 2.263324022293091, 0.5798184871673584], [0.0644193691345601, 0.2828177943964828, 0.839828629337719, 0.5276327729225159, 0.15082287788391113, 0.30097100915583713, 1.469675898551941, 0.0, 0.09489227545911598, 0.1094730435059867], [0.8551023248583078, 0.8510289192199707, 3.2188756465911865, 0.6161860823631287, 0.15082287788391113, 1.139477432572416, 3.9120230674743652, 0.0, 1.7471863428751628, 2.121869615146092], [0.34761776429201874, 0.9047833333412806, 2.4079456329345703, 0.597836971282959, 0.4004775285720825, 0.4899423803601946, 1.7147983312606812, 0.0, 1.434429794549942, 0.6088881407465253], [0.07711730334443129, 3.5992672954242493, 2.9802280870180256, 0.24686007793152578, 1.4180430594344708, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 0.10275973395776894, 0.13353139262452263, 1.7385149547092427], [0.1158318155251217, 2.2870809064580806, 1.1631508098056809, 1.1631508098056809, 1.0908301482260547, 4.1588830833596715, 0.6623755218931916, 0.42121346507630353, 0.24686007793152578, 1.7609878105613013]], "target_roberta_idx": [24, 32, 65, 86, 127, 130, 131, 132, 142, 161], "target_prob_idx": [22, 30, 61, 81, 117, 120, 121, 122, 132, 149]}

The main stages of the process include preparation of the base, addition of flavorings, carbonation, and packaging. The process begins with the preparation of the base, which is typically water that has been treated to remove impurities and minerals. The base is then combined with flavorings, such as fruit or spices, which are added to give the drink its desired taste. The flavorings can be natural or artificial, depending on the manufacturer's preference. Once the flavorings have been added, the mixture is carbonated by introducing carbon dioxide gas under pressure. This process creates bubbles in the liquid, which gives the drink its characteristic fizziness.

{"text": "The diagram illustrates the multi-step process of producing carbonated drinks, from ingredient mixing to final packaging. This essay will describe the main stages involved in the production of these beverages. Initially, the process begins with the mixing of ingredients. Water is treated to ensure purity before sugar and other ingredients, including flavors and colorings, are added. Once combined, the mixture is then cooled to allow for carbonation. Carbonation is the next critical step, where carbon dioxide (CO2) gas is infused into the chilled mixture, creating the fizz that characterizes carbonated drinks.

{"text": "Gonzo journalism is a style of journalism that was popularized in the 1960s and 1970s by writers such as Hunter S. Thompson and Ralph Steadman. It is characterized by its subjective and often unconventional approach to reporting, which often involves the reporter becoming an active participant in the story rather than simply observing it from the sidelines. Gonzo journalism often employs a first-person perspective and a conversational tone, and it frequently blurs the line between fact and opinion. The goal of gonzo journalism is to provide a more immersive and personal experience for the reader, rather than simply presenting a neutral, objective account of events. Gonzo journalism is often associated with the counterculture movement of the 1960s and 1970s, and it was often used to cover topics such as politics, drugs, and social justice. Some of the most famous examples of gonzo journalism include Thompson's book \"Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas\" and Steadman's illustrations for Rolling Stone magazine.", "label": "Llama-2-13b-chat-hf", "label_int": 3, "est_prob_list": [[3.9120230674743652, 3.912022829055786, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 3.9120230674743652, 3.912022829055786, 3.912022829055786, 3.912022829055786, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091], [3.2188758850097656, 3.2188756465911865, 3.2188757260640464, 3.2188758850097656, 2.4079456329345703, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 3.5065579414367676, 3.5065579414367676], [0.0, 0.5406856119632721, 0.04656059991544821, 0.0, 0.0, 0.05357549262696418, 0.17005814378208073, 0.22149120554901924, 1.0077578174982973, 0.4664636184803686], [0.26136478781700134, 1.8745716750621795, 0.4829896241426468, 0.0, 1.8325815200805664, 0.13926206529140472, 0.1915918035166604, 0.26136478781700134, 3.2188758850097656, 3.2188758850097656], [0.0, 0.14270914793014527, 0.06559174507856369, 0.0, 0.3424902558326721, 0.5276327729225159, 0.506376930645534, 0.4780358076095581, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091], [4.605170185988091, 0.9808292530117262, 2.4096832285504126, 0.09844007281325252, 1.3256697393034558, 0.08985632912186105, 2.7119641004233466, 1.2685113254635072, 1.6533571463689358, 0.6179237593223578], [4.605170185988091, 0.808978996085067, 1.807507826196194, 0.1980699137620938, 2.2129729343043585, 0.44531101665536404, 2.2870809064580806, 1.0233888674305223, 2.4541349911212467, 0.9007865453381898]], "target_roberta_idx": [26, 58, 59, 60, 73, 103, 104, 105, 123, 124], "target_prob_idx": [20, 50, 51, 52, 64, 89, 90, 91, 109, 110]}
{"text": "Gonzo journalism is a style of journalism that was popularized by the American journalist Hunter S. Thompson in the 1960s and 1970s. It is characterized by a subjective, personal, and often unconventional approach to reporting and storytelling. In gonzo journalism, the journalist becomes an active participant in the story, often using drugs, alcohol, and other substances to enhance their experiences and perceptions. The goal is to create a raw, unfiltered, and honest portrayal of the events or people being covered, often with a focus on the underground or counterculture. The term \"gonzo\" is believed to have originated from Thompson's time as a journalist in Puerto Rico, where he would often use the term \"gonzo\" to describe his writing style. He later popularized the term with his book \"Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas,\" which became a cult classic and a defining work of gonzo journalism. Gonzo journalism has been both praised and criticized for its unconventional approach to reporting.", "label": "vicuna-13b-v1.5", "label_int": 4, "est_prob_list": [[4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 3.0484421014785767, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091], [4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 2.5906823656775733, 2.3025851249694824, 2.3025851249694824, 4.605170185988091, 3.9120230674743652, 2.814235472679138, 4.605170185988091], [0.04356079796950022, 0.0, 0.03265761435031891, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 2.0901971235871315, 0.0, 0.4780358076095581, 3.5065579414367676], [0.2825561985373497, 0.1053604781627655, 1.1110454618930816, 0.0009136660532517867, 0.23572230339050293, 0.11786115169525146, 2.2566031992435454, 0.010050326585769653, 1.2378743886947632, 2.525728702545166], [0.03179281061413935, 0.0, 0.026176713119279688, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.3880064823672317, 0.0, 0.2761930533249835, 0.284640914434442], [4.605170185988091, 1.3256697393034558, 4.605170185988091, 1.5939337258981352, 0.5212969236332861, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 2.367123614131617], [4.605170185988091, 1.556193397915288, 2.6548056865833978, 1.2411123512753928, 2.2129729343043585, 4.605170185988091, 3.7534179752515073, 2.4541349911212467, 4.605170185988091, 3.242592351485517]], "target_roberta_idx": [46, 56, 64, 75, 91, 92, 102, 141, 153, 160], "target_prob_idx": [39, 48, 56, 67, 81, 82, 92, 129, 140, 146]}

The relationship between China and NK is not doing well right now.  After NK destroys Seoul and kills most of the US troops at the border, the US would retaliate. We would likely destroy the NK airforce within 2 days and then we would pummel Pyongyang relentlessly. However, as one of the other folks in this thread mentioned, the NK soldiers would likely go for guerrilla tactics and it would be a nightmare. Tough to say exactly what would happen but lots of people would die. Especially in Seoul.

They both have children now, but it was a difficult time for them. One of them has an autistic son, and she's trying to raise him as best she can. She talks about how hard it is to be a parent, and how much more challenging it is to raise a child with autism than most people realize.

{"text": "Certainly!

{"text": "A compressor is like an automatic volume control. You know the faders on a mixer that control volume? Well, imagine we programmed a robot to listen to the volume level, and when the volume went above a certain level, bring the fader down. Then, when the volume drops back below that level, bring it back up. That level where it starts to bring the fader down is called the *threshold*, and the amount that it brings the fader down is the *ratio*\\*\\*. Additionally, the delay when the input volume goes above the threshold until the fader is brought down is called the *attack* time, and the delay after the input volume goes back below the threshold is called the *release* time. Bringing the loud stuff down is *downward compression*, the opposite (bringing quiet stuff up) is *upward compression*, but upward is used a lot less. You use it to smooth the volume out, so everything is closer to the same level. Ever watch a movie at home where you had to turn the TV volume way up to hear the dialog, but then there an explosion that nearly blew out your ears? Compressing the audio would allow you to leave the TV volume the same and hear everything comfortably. As you can imagine, overusing a compressor will just take all the life out of the sound. --- \\*\\*This isn't exactly correct, but it works for a simple explanation.", "label": "human", "label_int": 0, "est_prob_list": [[4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091], [4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 1.6607311964035034, 2.835032380343051, 1.5491217224855893, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091], [4.1910778254867305, 1.0580246492234413, 0.32638354287435245, 1.5701234213810393, 3.8307982284755915, 0.18694766812286148, 0.7967406284361278, 2.919268525157116, 4.605170185988091, 0.0], [4.605170185988091, 0.5100028186059612, 0.3142573684453964, 1.366399349828152, 2.1620158678912493, 1.2903178688810282, 0.9736396324566636, 2.0580565452575685, 4.605170185988091, 0.010050326585769653], [4.605170185988091, 0.7415776496650954, 0.15249236673116684, 4.037265920639038, 4.605170185988091, 0.25070313454714427, 0.5174033321765685, 2.0932270646095277, 4.339223692847679, 0.010050326585769653], [4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 2.4541349911212467, 3.9357395320454622, 1.807507826196194, 4.446565155811453], [2.6548056865833978, 3.0602707946915624, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 3.7534179752515073, 2.906120114864304, 2.5494451709255714, 2.2129729343043585, 0.8266785731844679, 4.605170185988091]], "target_roberta_idx": [37, 87, 155, 196, 198, 205, 218, 240, 270, 289], "target_prob_idx": [35, 83, 149, 190, 192, 199, 212, 233, 262, 282]}
{"text": "The compressor is a very useful tool for any producer, especially if you are using an analog synth or sampler. It can be used as a simple limiter, but also as a dynamic compression tool that helps you achieve a certain sound quality. The compressor is usually applied after the signal has been processed by other processing such as reverbs, delays, chorus, etc. In this tutorial I will show you how to set up your own compressor with some basic settings. You should know that there are many different compressors out there, so make sure you have one of each type before starting. This tutorial assumes that you already have a working knowledge of audio editing software like Audacity . If not, check out my previous tutorials on audio editing software here . Step 1: Setting up your compressor First thing's first, let's get our hands dirty and create a new project in Audacity. We'll start off with a clean track with no effects applied. Click File > New Project... In the dialog box that pops up, select \"Audio\" from the drop down menu. Now we need to choose a name for our project. Since we're going to be applying a compressor to our track, we'll call it \"Compressor\". Next, click the small gear icon at the top right corner of the window and select \"New Audio Track\".

{"text": "Sure! Here's an explanation of how compressors work in music production and some tips on how to use them: A compressor is an audio effect that reduces the volume of an audio signal when it exceeds a certain threshold. This allows for more even-sounding audio and can help to bring out specific details in a mix. Compressors are commonly used on drums, vocals, and bass to control the overall level of the track and create a more balanced sound. Here's how a compressor works: 1. Threshold: This sets the level at which the compressor starts to reduce the volume of the audio signal. If the signal is below the threshold, the compressor won't do anything. 2. Ratio: This sets the amount of reduction in volume that the compressor applies to the signal once it exceeds the threshold. For example, a ratio of 4:1 means that for every 4 units of gain above the threshold, the compressor will reduce the signal by 1 unit. 3. Attack: This sets the time it takes for the compressor to start reducing the volume of the signal once it exceeds the threshold. A fast attack time will result in a more aggressive compression, while a slow attack time will result in a more gradual compression. 4. Release: This sets the time it takes for the compressor to return to its normal state after the signal drops below the threshold.", "label": "Llama-2-13b-chat-hf", "label_int": 3, "est_prob_list": [[4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 3.5065579414367676, 3.709290385246277, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 3.6591228246688843, 4.011044093540737], [3.5065579414367676, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 3.2188756465911865, 3.2188756465911865, 4.605170185988091, 2.999153232574463, 4.605170185988091, 3.2876326697213307], [0.15082287788391113, 0.0, 0.040822017937898636, 0.12577151382962862, 0.7985076308250427, 0.7985076308250427, 0.26136478781700134, 0.627191174030304, 0.007215369182756554, 0.10828878384615694], [1.2378742694854736, 0.0077344258315861225, 1.0498220920562744, 1.131026675303777, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 0.1053604781627655, 0.5264058351516724, 1.8325815200805664, 0.4816734322479793], [0.5621188282966614, 0.0, 0.2744368612766266, 4.605170185988091, 1.5141277313232422, 1.5141277313232422, 0.28768208622932434, 1.475860023498535, 0.010050326585769653, 0.05095429266137736], [3.347952867143343, 4.446565155811453, 4.1588830833596715, 4.605170185988091, 1.4343035803062512, 4.605170185988091, 0.7493868988828214, 1.2013720226258786, 1.8562979903656263, 1.7385149547092427], [1.7165360479904674, 4.605170185988091, 3.242592351485517, 3.242592351485517, 1.0018826622095587, 3.7534179752515073, 0.4575811092471784, 0.39768296766610944, 0.22705745063534608, 1.4847344339331432]], "target_roberta_idx": [56, 59, 72, 74, 95, 96, 108, 127, 192, 217], "target_prob_idx": [52, 55, 66, 68, 89, 90, 101, 120, 183, 208]}

There are several types of compressors, including optical, VCA, and FET. Each type has its own unique characteristics and is suited to different applications. To use a compressor in music production, you will need to first choose the type of compressor that you want to use. Then, you will need to set the threshold, which determines the level at which the compressor will start to work. You will also need to set the ratio, which determines the amount of compression that will be applied, and the attack and release times, which determine how quickly the compressor will react to changes in the audio signal. Once you have set up your compressor, you can use it to control the dynamic range of your audio signal. This can be especially useful when recording instruments or vocals with a wide dynamic range, as it can help to ensure that the quieter parts are not too quiet and the louder parts are not too loud.

{"text": "In music production, a compressor is an essential tool that helps control the dynamics of audio signals. Its primary function is to reduce the dynamic range of a sound, which means it reduces the difference between the loudest and softest parts of the audio signal. This helps to ensure that the overall volume level remains consistent and prevents any parts of the audio from becoming too loud or too soft. The basic working principle of a compressor involves three main components: threshold, ratio, and attack/release times. The threshold sets the level at which the compressor starts to reduce the volume. The ratio determines the amount of reduction applied to the audio signal once it exceeds the threshold. The attack time determines how quickly the compressor responds to the audio signal crossing the threshold, while the release time controls how long it takes for the compressor to stop reducing the volume once the audio signal falls below the threshold. To use a compressor effectively, it is important to understand its controls and adjust them according to the audio material. Here are some general steps: 1. Set the threshold: Determine the level at which you want the compressor to start reducing the volume. This can be done by observing the audio waveform or using your ears. 2. Adjust the ratio: Decide how much reduction you want to apply to the audio signal once it exceeds the threshold.

{"text": "In music production, a compressor is a dynamic range processor that reduces the volume of loud sounds or amplifies quiet sounds by narrowing or 'compressing' an audio signal's dynamic range. This is done to ensure that the overall level of a track or mix remains consistent and to prevent any part from being either too quiet or too loud, which can improve clarity and impact. Here's how a compressor works: 1. Threshold: This sets the level at which the compressor will start to work. If the input signal exceeds this level, the compressor will reduce the gain. 2. Ratio: This determines how much compression will be applied. For example, a 4:1 ratio means that if the input level is 4 dB over the threshold, the output level will be 1 dB over the threshold. 3. Attack: This controls how quickly the compressor reacts to signals that exceed the threshold. A fast attack time means the compressor will reduce the gain almost immediately, which is useful for managing transient sounds like drum hits. 4. Release: This sets how quickly the compressor stops compressing after the signal falls below the threshold. A longer release time can make the compression sound more natural. 5. Make-up Gain: After compression, the overall level of the signal might be lower. Make-up gain allows you to boost the output level to compensate for the gain reduction caused by compression. 6. Knee: This defines how the compressor transitions between non-compression and compression states.", "label": "gpt-4-1106-preview", "label_int": 7, "est_prob_list": [[4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 3.2188758850097656, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091], [4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 3.813002041407994, 3.455571719578334, 4.605170185988091, 2.6592600345611572, 3.6241795676095143, 2.1202635765075684, 2.810997421091253, 4.605170185988091], [4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 0.8472627401351929, 1.7719568014144897, 2.0402207374572754, 2.035301947593689, 0.6348783373832703, 0.030459178611636162, 2.5614089749076148, 0.12392040093739827], [4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 0.5265460695539202, 1.7147983312606812, 1.272965669631958, 3.171762466430664, 4.605170185988091, 0.02020268701016903, 2.6220532980832187, 0.09405684905747573], [4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 0.6142137135778155, 1.7147983312606812, 2.1202635765075684, 2.519823062419891, 1.56064772605896, 0.0, 1.9505686922506853, 0.2694939116636912], [2.6548056865833978, 1.9898293829901488, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 3.912023005428146, 0.07711730334443129, 3.9357395320454622, 0.38612214526503347, 2.9802280870180256, 3.506557897319982], [1.556193397915288, 1.1303978165597626, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 0.4093790074293007, 0.5283402028063905, 1.9616585060234524, 0.9202046311952914, 4.605170185988091]], "target_roberta_idx": [50, 51, 70, 71, 73, 92, 256, 266, 287, 289], "target_prob_idx": [46, 47, 66, 67, 69, 87, 246, 254, 274, 276]}

{"text": "In Australia there is a high proportion of people aged 65 years or older (17% of all Australians) compared to other developed countries such as Canada (10%) and Japan (8%). This has been attributed to our ageing population and low birth rate. In addition, many more elderly people are living alone than ever before due to an increase in life expectancy.

Inside a black hole, there is a supermassive object known as a singularity, which contains an immense amount of mass and is thought to be the source of gravitational waves.", "label": "alpaca-7b", "label_int": 5, "est_prob_list": [[4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 3.912022829055786, 3.912022829055786, 3.912022829055786, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091], [3.9120230674743652, 1.91791170835495, 2.6592600345611572, 2.6592600345611572, 2.6592600345611572, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 3.5065579414367676], [0.37106359004974365, 0.6465841908939183, 0.6628348429997762, 2.7997112572193146, 4.605170185988091, 2.207274913787842, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 0.01208079867064953, 0.02020268701016903], [1.9661128520965576, 0.2931858252650742, 0.1532003888517022, 0.06480560972930095, 0.22068541925134286, 1.0216511487960815, 0.42132453446539014, 3.9120230674743652, 0.08566335141658783, 0.0], [2.3025851249694824, 0.529998192563653, 1.310741901397705, 2.5924943685531616, 3.2188758850097656, 1.6607311964035034, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 0.008164403587579727, 0.0], [2.8371272433773522, 0.39768296766610944, 0.18388527877013736, 0.0813456394539524, 0.5412311385341033, 4.446565155811453, 0.8817383503674954, 0.808978996085067, 0.40351388797690263, 1.5378442592470916], [1.9616585060234524, 1.9616585060234524, 0.18859116980755003, 0.2076393647782445, 2.4541349911212467, 4.605170185988091, 0.5753641449035618, 0.9602099658089905, 2.5494451709255714, 0.42121346507630353]], "target_roberta_idx": [38, 49, 57, 58, 59, 78, 79, 80, 90, 96], "target_prob_idx": [37, 48, 56, 57, 58, 77, 78, 79, 87, 93]}

The lower esophageal sphincter prevents the backflow of acidic contents into the esophagus, while the pyloric sphincter controls the release of stomach contents into the small intestine. 2.

The brand was founded in 2018 by Daniel Kim, who previously worked as a stylist for celebrities such as G-Dragon and BIGBANG. NewJeans' popularity can be attributed to several unique qualities that set them apart from other fashion brands. Firstly, their designs are heavily influenced by 90s and early 2000s streetwear, which has seen a resurgence in popularity in recent years. The brand's founders, Daniel Kim and Minju Kim, are both in their 30s and grew up during this era, so they have a deep understanding of what made those eras' fashion trends tick.

For example, you might think of a planet with intelligent life as being like a person who has been in prison all their lives. If someone came along and told them what was going on outside, they'd probably say \"What's wrong with my cell?\" or something similar. The same thing applies here.

{"text": "Liam Swayne's AI project aimed to evaluate the replaceability of writers with artificial intelligence. Based on his findings, Swayne drew several conclusions regarding the replaceability of writers: Firstly, Swayne found that AI algorithms can generate coherent and engaging content, but they struggle to replicate the creativity, nuance, and emotional depth of human writers. While AI can produce factually correct content, it often lacks the unique perspective and personal touch that human writers bring to their work.

{"text": "Sprinter Michelle Collins has lodged an appeal against her eight-year doping ban with the North American Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS). The 33-year-old received the ban last month as a result of her connection to the federal inquiry into the Balco doping scandal. She is the first athlete to be banned without a positive drugs test or an admission of drugs use. CAS has said that a ruling is normally given within four months of an appeal. Collins was suspended by the US Anti-Doping Agency based on patterns observed in her blood and urine tests as well as evidence in the Balco investigation.

The High Court ruled last month that the government had acted unlawfully by banning the drug, which is known as MDMA or Ecstasy.

He said there were still \"significant gaps\" in the legislation. The judge also criticised the way the government had handled the case.

{"text": "u/masterchief0213 is slightly wrong on a number of issues primarily concerning his point 2.  > The actual lens in your eye has to be stretched to change its focal point to keep things in focus This is not how accommodation (the process by which humans view objects close to them) works. What actually happens is that the lens in the eye is held in a stretched position by a relaxed circular muscle attached to the lens via what are called zonules when viewing **distant objects**. This does not put stress on that muscle as it is relaxed when viewing these objects. **To view objects close to you** that muscle contracts to relieve tension on the lens and allow it to become more compact and slightly more circular. This means it provides more power (a concept that allows for quantification of the ability of a lens to focus objects at certain distances) to allow the lens to focus on a closer object.  > especially as we age, it gets tired from doing this and it becomes harder to focus on close-up things. This is probably also misleading in that there is little evidence to suggest significant loss in muscle ability with age. The process by which our near vision worsens has little to do with eye strain. Eye strain can be related to accommodation or in short sighted people may be related to screwing up of eyes to improve distance vision. edit: formatting and clarification", "label": "human", "label_int": 0, "est_prob_list": [[4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 3.912022829055786, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091], [4.605170185988091, 3.518779325098781, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 3.5065579414367676, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091], [4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 2.7258288115262985, 4.605170185988091, 0.04082195460796356, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 1.2011154473196697, 2.0402209758758545], [4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 1.931784464621691, 3.340397376826995, 4.605170185988091, 0.1213649418262143, 4.2847442626953125, 2.207274913787842, 0.4740142554191738, 2.4079456329345703], [4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 3.8634929869285153, 4.605170185988091, 0.02020268701016903, 4.014434099197388, 4.483744420806858, 1.616772096440714, 4.605170185988091], [4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 0.39188584998178355, 1.5378442592470916, 0.15154989812720093, 4.605170185988091, 3.0602707946915624, 4.605170185988091], [4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 3.7534179752515073, 4.605170185988091, 0.34117075740276714, 2.6548056865833978, 0.5212969236332861, 4.605170185988091, 4.1588830833596715, 4.605170185988091]], "target_roberta_idx": [32, 39, 95, 167, 168, 171, 173, 176, 177, 214], "target_prob_idx": [25, 32, 86, 160, 161, 164, 166, 169, 170, 204]}
{"text": "Because we are not used to seeing the world in black and white. The eye is a very sensitive organ, and it has been known for centuries that when you look at something with one eye closed, your brain will be more likely to perceive color than if you were looking through two eyes. This is why people who have had cataracts removed often report having difficulty reading or driving after they've had their lenses removed. It's also why many of us get headaches from staring at bright lights. When we see things in black and white, our brains are less able to process them. The Solution: To overcome this problem, try using colored glasses or contact lenses. If you can't afford these, you could always use an inexpensive pair of sunglasses.

Eye conditions: Certain eye conditions, such as myopia (nearsightedness), hyperopia (farsightedness), and presbyopia (age-related loss of near vision), can cause eye strain. 5. Medications: Certain medications, such as antidepressants and antihistamines, can cause eye strain as a side effect. 6. Eye movement disorders: Conditions such as blepharospasm (eyelid spasms) and strabismus (crossed eyes) can cause eye strain. 7.

{"text": "We get eye strain when the eye muscles become fatigued from prolonged use. The eye muscles control the movement of the eyes and when they become tired they can lead to eye strain. This can be caused by looking at a computer or phone screen for long periods of time, or reading for extended periods of time. In addition, environmental factors such as bright sunlight or glare can cause eye strain. Other factors such as insufficient sleep, caffeine, and alcohol can also contribute to eye strain.  The most common symptom of eye strain is fatigue in the eyes, which can lead to blurred vision, headaches, and difficulty focusing on objects. Other symptoms can include dry eyes, itchy eyes, sensitivity to light, and double vision. If eye strain is not treated, it can lead to more serious eye problems such as vision loss and even blindness. Therefore, it's important to take preventative measures to protect your eyes from eye strain.  The best way to prevent eye strain is to create a healthy lifestyle habit of taking regular breaks from screens, getting plenty of sleep, and maintaining a healthy diet. Additionally, it's important to protect your eyes from environmental factors such as bright sunlight or glare by wearing sunglasses and a wide brimmed hat.

{"text": "Eye strain, also known as asthenopia, is a common condition that occurs when the eyes become fatigued or overworked. There are several factors that contribute to the development of eye strain. One of the main causes of eye strain is prolonged or intense use of digital devices such as computers, smartphones, and tablets. Staring at a screen for extended periods of time can cause the eyes to become dry and irritated. Additionally, the high levels of blue light emitted by these devices can disrupt the sleep-wake cycle, leading to eye fatigue. Another contributing factor to eye strain is poor lighting conditions. Insufficient or excessive lighting can strain the eyes as they continuously adjust to the changing brightness levels. Reading or working in dimly lit or excessively bright environments can cause eye discomfort and fatigue. The improper positioning of screens or reading materials can also lead to eye strain. When the screen is too close or too far away, the eyes have to work harder to focus, leading to strain. Similarly, when reading materials are held too close or at an awkward angle, it can cause eye discomfort. Other factors that can contribute to eye strain include uncorrected vision problems, such as nearsightedness, farsightedness, or astigmatism. When the eyes have difficulty focusing properly, it can lead to eye strain.

The process of incresment of acidity (or low pH values) are subjected to a strong variation in the 40 minutes occurring after sweet foods are eaten. The risk that a tooth decay occurs is high mostly if you eat cane sugar. Before eating sweet foods the level of pH is neutral. 5 minutes after sugar has been eaten, the situation is radically different. The level of pH plummet down, around 3,5 if you eat cane sugare. After 5 minutes the level of pH arrives at the maximum of the acidity level that can be caused by sugar. Then, the level of pH starts deacreasing slowly again and after 30 minutes (if cane sugar had been eaten) or a little bit less (20-25 minutes) if honey or fruit sugar had been eaten, the acidity is almost normal (between 6 and 7). The risk that a tooth decay occurs are very high, mostly if the the sweet product eaten is cane sugar. Instead, the possibility that a problem like tooth decay arise is very low if honey had been eaten. Specifically, the minutes under risk are just 15 if you had eaten honey and more that 30 if you had chosen cane sugar. A tooth decay can occur when the level of pH is lower that 5.5. Then, the acidity of honey remains always lower that that of cane sugar and for this reason the risky minutes are lower.", "label": "human", "label_int": 0, "est_prob_list": [[4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 3.912022829055786, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091], [4.605170185988091, 3.001671609281989, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 3.2188756465911865, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.325470932902722, 4.605170185988091], [4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 2.6592600345611572, 4.605170185988091, 3.419298640756926, 3.9611591682022325, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 1.3771071482019235], [4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 3.954048758401889, 4.605170185988091, 2.248073798418045, 3.479437232017517, 4.605170185988091, 4.413224875926971, 1.3812083446733134], [4.605170185988091, 2.003889100626111, 4.605170185988091, 2.5015915525198396, 4.605170185988091, 3.1352414044078283, 3.8114602989969635, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 1.4784679477219052], [4.605170185988091, 2.4541349911212467, 1.9616585060234524, 4.1588830833596715, 4.446565155811453, 4.605170185988091, 1.0018826622095587, 3.4657359027997265, 0.22705745063534608, 4.1588830833596715], [4.605170185988091, 3.0602707946915624, 1.9075912847531766, 3.7534179752515073, 3.7534179752515073, 4.605170185988091, 0.7248958788745256, 2.906120114864304, 0.6035350218702582, 4.1588830833596715]], "target_roberta_idx": [42, 54, 61, 96, 100, 114, 116, 117, 152, 300], "target_prob_idx": [35, 47, 54, 89, 93, 103, 105, 106, 138, 281]}
{"text": "The human body is a complex system that requires a balance of acids to maintain its functions. The stomach has an acidic environment with a pH value of 4.5-4.6. This means that there is a high concentration of hydrogen ions (H+) present in the stomach. These H+ ions have the ability to dissolve calcium carbonate (CaCO3). Calcium carbonate is used as a mineral supplement to help prevent tooth decay. When this happens, it causes the teeth to become more porous, allowing bacteria to enter into the tooth cavity. In order to protect the teeth from becoming infected, the body uses enzymes called enamel remineralization enzymes to break down the calcium carbonate. Enamel remineralization enzymes are produced by the saliva glands. They work by breaking up the calcium carbonate crystals that form on the surface of the teeth. The process of remineralizing the teeth is very important because it prevents the formation of cavities. Remineralized teeth also contain less plaque, making them easier to clean. When the pH level of the stomach drops too low, the enzyme activity decreases and the amount of CaCO3 dissolved in the stomach increases. This results in a decrease in the production of enamel remineralization enzymes. As a result, the amount of calcium carbonate that remains in the teeth decreases. In addition, the pH of the stomach will increase again when the stomach's contents are digested and absorbed.

{"text": "In response to the given prompt, I would write an essay discussing the implications of eating sweet foods on dental health, focusing on the production of acid in the mouth and its effects on tooth decay. Here is my essay: Eating sweet foods and drinks is a common habit that many people have, but it can have severe implications for dental health. Sweet foods and drinks are high in sugar content, which when consumed, are converted into acid by the bacteria in the mouth. This acid can cause tooth decay, as it erodes the enamel of the teeth, leading to cavities and other oral health problems. The acid produced in the mouth as a result of consuming sweet foods and drinks has a low pH level, which indicates high acidity. This low pH level can damage the enamel of the teeth, making them more susceptible to decay. The bacteria in the mouth feed on the sugar in sweet foods and drinks, producing lactic acid as a byproduct. This acid can stay in the mouth for hours, giving the bacteria ample time to multiply and produce more acid, further damaging the teeth. Tooth decay is a common problem worldwide, affecting people of all ages. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), tooth decay is one of the most common oral health problems, affecting 60-90% of schoolchildren and the majority of adults.

{"text": "Title: The Impact of Sweet Foods on Dental Health Introduction Sweet foods, such as candies, pastries, and sugary drinks, are a staple in many people's diets worldwide. While these treats can bring temporary joy and satisfaction, they can also have detrimental effects on dental health. The acid produced by the consumption of sweet foods can lead to tooth decay and other dental issues. This essay will describe the relationship between sweet foods, acid production, and dental health, and discuss the implications of this relationship. Description When sweet foods are consumed, the bacteria in the mouth break down the sugar and produce acids. These acids can have a pH value lower than 7, which is considered acidic. The acidic environment in the mouth can dissolve the enamel, the hard, outer layer of the tooth, leading to tooth decay. The severity of tooth decay depends on the frequency and duration of sweet food consumption, as well as oral hygiene practices such as brushing and flossing. In addition to tooth decay, frequent consumption of sweet foods can also contribute to other dental issues.

{"text": "Tooth decay is a prevalent oral health issue caused by the production of acid in the mouth, primarily resulting from the consumption of sweet foods. The pH scale is used to measure acid levels, with low pH values indicating high acid content. This essay will explore the information regarding the acid production caused by sweet foods and discuss its implications for dental health. When individuals consume sweet foods, the bacteria present in the mouth metabolize the sugars and produce acids as byproducts. These acids, particularly lactic and acetic acid, can lower the pH levels in the mouth, leading to a more acidic environment. This acidic environment is detrimental to dental health as it demineralizes the tooth enamel, making it more susceptible to decay. Dental health implications arise from the continuous exposure of teeth to high acid levels. Firstly, the demineralization of tooth enamel weakens the protective layer of the teeth, leaving them vulnerable to cavities. Over time, if not addressed, these cavities can progress and affect the deeper layers of the tooth, potentially leading to tooth sensitivity, pain, and even tooth loss. Moreover, the acid produced by sweet foods can also contribute to the development of dental erosion. Dental erosion occurs when the acid directly attacks the tooth enamel, causing it to wear away gradually. This can result in the exposure of the dentin, a softer layer beneath the enamel, leading to increased tooth sensitivity and a higher risk of cavities.", "label": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "label_int": 6, "est_prob_list": [[4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 3.9120230674743652, 3.885588859518369, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091], [4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 3.97503644769842, 4.605170185988091, 3.912022829055786, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 2.6592600345611572, 4.605170185988091], [0.03195834532380104, 0.12783338129520416, 1.249128034338355, 0.40173028750965994, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 2.995732307434082, 0.5276327729225159, 0.0, 0.07902035862207413], [0.3273333013057709, 1.3093332052230835, 2.4643391621383754, 0.9793529395634929, 4.605170185988091, 2.4079456329345703, 0.3566748797893524, 0.3011050820350647, 0.0, 0.03061646595597267], [0.20716465264558792, 0.7985076308250427, 1.6920333799313416, 0.3462628275156021, 4.605170185988091, 3.912022829055786, 1.5141277313232422, 0.11653383076190948, 0.0, 0.13974720239639282], [0.06453852113757118, 0.06946725808153746, 0.5893503868783018, 2.4541349911212467, 0.44305707738739875, 1.0233888674305223, 0.2518726197550701, 0.06993281191649002, 0.00015800490659291278, 0.04937711723809112], [0.1158318155251217, 0.7088955375280844, 1.7609878105613013, 0.9808292530117262, 0.4953214372300254, 1.8562979903656263, 0.2173012756899814, 0.7915872533731978, 0.3194307707663612, 0.4953214372300254]], "target_roberta_idx": [22, 23, 24, 37, 44, 85, 93, 120, 207, 216], "target_prob_idx": [20, 21, 22, 35, 42, 82, 89, 114, 189, 198]}
{"text": "As an IELTS candidate, it is important to structure your response clearly and cohesively. Begin by paraphrasing the question, then describe the information provided, and finally, discuss the implications for dental health. --- The consumption of sweet items is known to generate acidic conditions within the oral cavity, leading to a reduction in pH levels. This acidic environment is a contributing factor to the deterioration of dental health, specifically through the process of tooth decay. Upon eating sugary foods, bacteria present in the mouth metabolize these sugars, releasing acid as a byproduct. This process initiates a drop in the pH value within the mouth. Typically, the mouth maintains a neutral pH of around 7, but when sugary foods are consumed, the pH can fall to more acidic levels. It is widely accepted that when the pH level drops below the critical threshold of 5.5, the acid begins to dissolve the minerals in the tooth enamel, a condition termed demineralization. This weakening of enamel is the precursor to cavities or dental caries. Over time, frequent exposure to low pH levels due to regular intake of sweets can lead to significant enamel erosion. This erosion increases the likelihood of developing tooth decay, as the protective enamel layer becomes compromised, allowing bacteria to infect the inner structures of the tooth. To mitigate these detrimental effects, it is crucial to maintain good oral hygiene practices, such as regular brushing and flossing, to remove food particles and plaque.", "label": "gpt-4-1106-preview", "label_int": 7, "est_prob_list": [[4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 3.912022829055786, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091], [3.5065579414367676, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 3.2188758850097656, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091], [0.42455740911620005, 0.13926206529140472, 0.13926206529140472, 0.0, 2.9340171217918396, 0.2891668478647868, 4.605170185988091, 1.6094378232955933, 2.331821584701538, 0.02020268701016903], [2.668049680335181, 0.12783338129520416, 0.12783338129520416, 0.0, 2.934017300605774, 0.42432188987731934, 4.605170185988091, 1.1394343376159668, 1.178157424926758, 0.0], [0.4414685198238918, 0.1984509527683258, 0.1984509527683258, 0.005025163292884827, 1.0703373849391937, 0.8864200115203857, 4.605170185988091, 1.309333324432373, 1.8480982780456543, 0.0], [2.7119641004233466, 0.20284319251475147, 0.179201429457711, 3.9357395320454622, 3.5992672954242493, 3.912023005428146, 0.8538295622504187, 0.15154989812720093, 1.8562979903656263, 1.5378442592470916], [3.0602707946915624, 0.26706278524904525, 0.07712628543079117, 1.3256697393034558, 1.3862943611198906, 4.605170185988091, 1.1168525530461162, 0.31205733983749817, 1.1884686177899708, 0.8266785731844679]], "target_roberta_idx": [99, 100, 101, 125, 142, 143, 150, 260, 261, 278], "target_prob_idx": [92, 93, 94, 115, 132, 133, 139, 238, 239, 256]}

Infact, people specially youngsters get affected as they get easily influenced and under peer pressure perform these tasks without any guidance or safety, for instance, road racing which is the major cause for accidents in many countries which not only effect them but the public arround, another example is Death's well where car drivers drive the car in a well in circular motion where their is no guarantee of life where at any moment people can die. Secondly, everyone should have right to perform sports or activities according to their taste, however, safety is the primary concern that one should keep in mind. while stopping all the ones which can actually take a life should not be performed. As a result, these dangerous events has various outcomes majority of the performers turnout to be handicapped or with broken bones. so guidelines and measures taken by government is necessary.

{"text": "The first view is the one which I support because it makes sense for me. The second view is not a good idea as it will lead to more accidents and injuries in our society. This is why we need to make sure that there are laws against certain activities such as driving fast cars on public roads. If these rules were not put into place then many lives would be lost due to reckless behaviour of drivers who drive too fast. We also need to protect children from getting hurt by playing with guns or knives at home. These types of things can cause serious injury if they happen accidentally. It's important to note that some countries like Australia don't allow their citizens to play contact sport (like rugby) so this shows how much safety precautions must be taken when doing something risky. In my opinion, banning dangerous sports is an effective way of preventing deaths and injuries caused by them. In fact, most of us know someone who has died after participating in a dangerous sport. For example, football players often get injured during matches but no-one seems to care about them until they die later on. There was even a case where a young man died after being hit by another player's head during a game. He had been knocked out and his brain swelled up inside his skull causing him to lose consciousness. When he woke up again, he couldn't move his arms and legs properly and eventually passed away. Another person died after taking part in a race car event called 'the Indianapolis 500'.", "label": "gpt-j-6b", "label_int": 2, "est_prob_list": [[4.605170185988091, 3.9120230674743652, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 3.5065579414367676], [4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 3.5065579414367676, 4.532498624589708, 2.4079456329345703, 2.3552653789520264, 3.2188758850097656, 3.5065579414367676, 2.634969127830118, 4.605170185988091], [2.9218128068106517, 2.813410758972168, 3.9120230674743652, 1.6046805613570743, 3.2188758850097656, 1.6966146528720856, 3.3011625607808432, 0.13926199078559875, 3.5065579414367676, 3.1363629829138517], [4.407128197806222, 1.0788096189498901, 2.1202633380889893, 2.683118720021513, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.143072128295898, 0.0, 3.5065579414367676, 4.605170185988091], [3.226320947919573, 2.525728702545166, 3.2188758850097656, 2.456084998945395, 2.4079456329345703, 1.687764823436737, 3.7254844506581626, 0.051293306052684784, 3.5065579414367676, 2.748405948281288], [1.2411123512753928, 4.605170185988091, 0.2221674653411543, 4.605170185988091, 0.13353139262452263, 4.1588830833596715, 0.20284319251475147, 1.881615798349916, 1.881615798349916, 4.446565155811453], [2.772588722239781, 4.605170185988091, 0.6931471805599453, 4.605170185988091, 0.27731928541623435, 4.1588830833596715, 0.48258241145259567, 2.367123614131617, 2.1439800628174073, 4.605170185988091]], "target_roberta_idx": [36, 87, 149, 165, 173, 174, 185, 217, 243, 285], "target_prob_idx": [35, 86, 148, 164, 172, 173, 184, 214, 240, 281]}

These proponents of banning dangerous sports point out that the long-term health consequences of these activities can be severe, and that the risks far outweigh any potential benefits. On the other hand, those who argue in favor of individual freedom in sports contend that people should be allowed to participate in any activity they choose, as long as they are aware of the risks involved. These proponents of individual freedom point out that many people find personal fulfillment and enjoyment in participating in dangerous sports, and that the government should not be the arbiter of what activities are deemed acceptable or unacceptable.

While some argue that banning dangerous sports is necessary to protect individuals from harm, others believe that people should have the freedom to pursue their interests. In this essay, I will discuss both views and present my own opinion. On one hand, those in favor of banning dangerous sports argue that these activities pose significant risks to individuals' physical and mental well-being. They argue that by banning such sports, governments can prevent injuries, reduce healthcare costs, and protect individuals from potentially life-threatening situations. For example, activities like extreme skydiving or base jumping can lead to fatal accidents, and it is the responsibility of the government to ensure the safety of its citizens. On the other hand, proponents of individual freedom argue that adults should have the right to make their own choices regarding the sports they participate in. They believe that taking risks and engaging in dangerous sports is a personal decision, and individuals should be allowed to pursue their passions without interference from the government. Moreover, they argue that banning dangerous sports would infringe upon personal liberties and limit individuals' opportunities for personal growth and self-discovery.

{"text": "The debate over whether governments should impose bans on dangerous sports is a contentious one. On one hand, proponents of such bans argue that the inherent risks associated with these activities are too high, necessitating state intervention to protect individuals from harm. On the other hand, advocates for personal freedom contend that individuals should retain the right to choose which sports or activities they participate in, regardless of the potential dangers involved. Those in favor of government bans on dangerous sports often cite the duty of the state to safeguard the well-being of its citizens. Sports like base jumping, extreme skiing, or bull riding carry with them a high probability of injury or even death. Supporters of a ban believe that by limiting access to such high-risk activities, the government can reduce the burden on healthcare systems, prevent avoidable tragedies, and protect those who may not fully appreciate the risks involved. Furthermore, they argue that the social costs, including the impact on families and communities when accidents occur, can be mitigated through such prohibitions. Conversely, those who oppose government bans stress the importance of personal liberty and responsibility. They argue that individuals have the right to assess the risks of their activities and make their own decisions regarding their participation. This perspective holds that it is not the role of the government to restrict freedoms simply because an activity carries a risk. Moreover, enthusiasts of dangerous sports often develop a deep understanding of safety protocols and invest in proper training and equipment to mitigate risks, suggesting that informed individuals can safely engage in such activities.", "label": "gpt-4-1106-preview", "label_int": 7, "est_prob_list": [[4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 3.9613950490951537, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091], [4.605170185988091, 3.5065579414367676, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 3.912022829055786, 4.605170185988091, 3.940089919350364, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091], [0.24757485389709472, 2.0041613280773163, 0.02020268701016903, 3.3809270024299622, 0.05129324272274971, 4.605170185988091, 0.9124100811102174, 0.2744368612766266, 0.2376010020573934, 0.31471070647239685], [0.3321462392807007, 1.2816728949546814, 0.04082195460796356, 3.8082442045211793, 0.3856624662876129, 2.674165512124697, 0.25845134258270264, 0.07257068157196045, 1.383638322353363, 1.8971199989318848], [0.16419610977172852, 1.9584276378154755, 0.09431064873933792, 3.2140049815177916, 0.05129324272274971, 4.605170185988091, 0.7999281503937461, 0.2231435328722, 1.1880387632797162, 1.7719568014144897], [0.3087354816496133, 2.9802280870180256, 0.930056927638303, 4.605170185988091, 0.08559193033540351, 4.605170185988091, 1.4508328822574619, 1.881615798349916, 0.20284319251475147, 1.0233888674305223], [0.3746934494414107, 0.7914574660147157, 0.017680456757261334, 4.605170185988091, 0.6179237593223578, 1.89816014455029, 1.2144441041932315, 0.12325130216536244, 0.6776429940239801, 1.3862943611198906]], "target_roberta_idx": [25, 54, 63, 130, 135, 178, 220, 221, 231, 232], "target_prob_idx": [24, 52, 61, 126, 131, 171, 212, 213, 223, 224]}

{"text": "There can be several reasons why you may experience muscle soreness hours after a workout, rather than during or immediately after the exercise. Here are some possible explanations: 1. Lactic acid buildup: Lactic acid is produced during high-intensity exercises, such as weightlifting or sprinting. As your body processes lactic acid, it can cause muscle soreness. However, lactic acid is usually broken down and removed from your muscles within an hour after your workout. If you experience muscle soreness hours after your workout, it may be due to other factors. 2. Micro-tears in muscle fibers: When you engage in strenuous exercise, you may experience micro-tears in your muscle fibers. These micro-tears can cause inflammation and muscle soreness, which can last for hours or even days after your workout. 3. Muscle fatigue: If you perform a new exercise or increase the intensity of your workout, your muscles may become fatigued.

{"text": "Delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS) is a common phenomenon experienced by many individuals after a workout. It is characterized by muscle pain and stiffness that peaks around 24-48 hours after exercise and can last up to 72 hours. The exact cause of DOMS is not fully understood, but there are a few theories that explain why the muscle soreness is felt hours after the workout and not immediately. One theory suggests that DOMS is caused by microscopic damage to muscle fibers during exercise. When you work out, especially with new or intense exercises, you place stress on your muscles that they are not accustomed to. This stress can cause tiny tears in the muscle fibers and trigger an inflammatory response. The pain associated with DOMS is believed to be a result of this inflammation and the subsequent repair process. Another theory is that DOMS is caused by the buildup of metabolic waste products such as lactic acid. During exercise, your muscles produce lactic acid as a byproduct of energy metabolism. However, lactic acid is typically cleared from the muscles relatively quickly.", "label": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "label_int": 6, "est_prob_list": [[3.8004512786865234, 2.995732307434082, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 3.912022829055786, 4.605170185988091, 3.9120230674743652, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091], [4.605170185988091, 3.912022829055786, 2.6592600345611572, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 3.912022829055786, 2.995732307434082, 2.995732307434082, 2.0402209758758545, 2.0402209758758545], [0.14462342485785484, 0.3856624662876129, 0.7993020936846733, 0.12783338129520416, 0.12783338129520416, 1.0728157692189728, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 1.469675898551941, 0.7348379492759705], [0.10788074880838394, 0.2876819968223572, 1.1245057135820389, 0.17435334622859955, 0.17435334622859955, 2.976375109383038, 3.9120230674743652, 4.605170185988091, 2.813410758972168, 1.4117305427789688], [0.02721400558948517, 0.07257068157196045, 1.2644097208976746, 0.5798184871673584, 0.5798184871673584, 1.3634095532553536, 3.9120230674743652, 3.5395002514123917, 1.3862943649291992, 0.6931471824645996], [2.9802280870180256, 0.0909455416661313, 2.4541349911212467, 0.07723429014137038, 3.147282171681192, 0.5082248420659333, 0.09844007281325252, 0.07681217109620848, 0.31406882762497584, 0.3633938941874773], [1.8562979903656263, 0.5479651707154474, 2.5494451709255714, 2.4541349911212467, 1.7165360479904674, 0.27731928541623435, 0.2173012756899814, 0.6473376445286511, 0.1158318155251217, 0.16989903679539747]], "target_roberta_idx": [39, 40, 118, 125, 126, 159, 169, 175, 190, 191], "target_prob_idx": [33, 34, 109, 116, 117, 149, 158, 164, 177, 178]}
{"text": "Muscle soreness that occurs hours after a workout is known as delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS). DOMS typically begins 12-24 hours after exercise and can peak at around 24-72 hours post-workout. The discomfort is a result of microscopic damage to muscle fibers that occurs during exercise, particularly when the muscles are performing eccentric contractions (actively lengthening under tension), as in the lowering phase of a weightlifting exercise or running downhill. During the eccentric phase, more force is placed on the muscle, leading to more significant damage than during concentric (muscle shortening) actions. This microtrauma triggers an inflammatory response in the muscle, leading to the sensation of pain and stiffness associated with DOMS. The inflammation and pain are part of the healing process that helps the muscles recover and adapt, growing stronger to better handle future stress. The reason for the delayed sensation of pain is that it takes time for the inflammation and subsequent sensitization of nerve endings to develop after the initial muscle damage.", "label": "gpt-4-1106-preview", "label_int": 7, "est_prob_list": [[4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 3.912022829055786, 4.605170185988091, 3.9120229482650757, 3.7501871585845947], [4.605170185988091, 1.5305183812355, 1.936714510122935, 4.605170185988091, 2.917416845049177, 4.605170185988091, 3.2188758850097656, 2.1202635765075684, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091], [1.1309902927217383, 0.707799474398295, 4.605170185988091, 0.5660862624645233, 0.14935130732400076, 2.150191698844234, 0.15082287788391113, 0.6648150086402893, 2.881675402323405, 1.6457231640815735], [0.6579822010050217, 2.3701207215587297, 2.407945394515991, 0.8291173525568512, 0.89179870060512, 4.605170185988091, 0.20944268628954887, 2.5075377449393272, 3.660765767097473, 2.312686468474567], [0.8466744863738617, 1.9453713248173397, 1.7147983312606812, 0.13434098660945892, 0.6879844665527344, 2.632308192551136, 0.7688179612159729, 0.7489330768585205, 1.6905532677968342, 0.636482834815979], [3.912023005428146, 1.0018826622095587, 2.0794415416798357, 1.0792693258249788, 4.446565155811453, 0.2518726197550701, 4.605170185988091, 0.7744928200138977, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091], [4.605170185988091, 0.31340119402050753, 1.4402644619105158, 1.5939337258981352, 0.10021075941103867, 0.22599608242366187, 2.906120114864304, 0.24460091617547824, 4.1588830833596715, 1.7165360479904674]], "target_roberta_idx": [42, 59, 81, 95, 106, 129, 145, 186, 202, 203], "target_prob_idx": [33, 47, 68, 81, 92, 110, 126, 166, 181, 182]}
{"text": "Anil Ambani, the younger of the two brothers in charge of India's largest private company, has resigned from running its petrochemicals subsidiary. The move is likely to be seen as the latest twist in a feud between Mr Ambani and his brother Mukesh. Anil, 45, has stepped down as director and vice-chairman of Indian Petrochemicals Corporation (IPC). The company was not available for comment. IPC is 46%-owned by Reliance Industries which in turn is run by Mukesh. Mukesh has spoken of ownership issues between the two brothers, who took over control of the Reliance empire following the death of their father in July, 2002. Reliance's operations have massive reach, covering textiles, telecommunications, petrochemicals, petroleum refining and marketing, as well as oil and gas exploration, insurance and financial services. The brothers' spat has hogged headlines in India during recent weeks, despite a denial from the family that there was anything wrong. Speculation has been rife about what has triggered the stand-off, with some observers blaming Anil's political ambitions, others the heavy investment by Mukesh and Reliance in a mobile phone venture. Shares of IPC dipped on the news in Mumbai, but recovered to trade almost 6% higher.

In a statement released to the stock exchange, the company said that Ambani had resigned from his role effective immediately. The reason for his departure was not given, but it comes at a time when the company is facing significant financial challenges. Ambani, who is the younger brother of billionaire business magnate Mukesh Ambani, has been at the helm of Reliance Group since its inception in the early 2000s. Under his leadership, the company has expanded into a wide range of sectors, including telecom, energy, and retail. However, the company has been facing financial difficulties in recent years, with its debt mounting to over $10 billion. The company has also been facing competition from newer, more aggressive players in the market. The departure of Ambani comes as a surprise to many in the business community, who had expected him to lead the company through its current challenges.

The liquidation of Reliance AXIS marks the end of an era for the Reliance Group, which had once been hailed as India's \"biggest business house\".

{"text": "Reliance Group, the conglomerate led by Indian businessman Anil Ambani, has announced the departure of one of its units. Reliance Communications, the telecommunications arm of the group, has officially severed ties with Anil Ambani due to ongoing financial struggles. The decision comes as no surprise, as Reliance Communications has been grappling with a massive debt burden of around $7 billion. The company has been battling fierce competition in the Indian telecom sector, which has led to a sharp decline in its market share and revenue. Anil Ambani, who was once considered one of the most prominent figures in the Indian business world, has faced numerous setbacks in recent years. His personal wealth has taken a significant hit, and he has been dealing with legal challenges and mounting debts. Reliance Communications' board of directors made the decision to remove Anil Ambani from his post after careful consideration of the company's financial situation.

The unit, which was an integral part of Ambani's business empire, has seen a decline in fortunes parallel to the financial troubles that have besieged Anil Ambani's ventures in recent years. The separation comes at a time when the Reliance ADA Group is grappling with debt resolution processes and legal battles. Anil Ambani, once listed among the world's richest individuals, has faced a tumultuous period with his businesses, especially in the telecom and power sectors, which failed to keep up with market competition and incurred substantial debts. This latest move could mark a strategic shift for the remaining businesses under Ambani's control as they attempt to stabilize and restructure operations. It is also indicative of the broader challenges faced by legacy business magnates in India, who are competing in an increasingly dynamic and technology-driven market environment. The departure of Anil Ambani from the unit could open up opportunities for new leadership and strategic partnerships that may help in reviving its prospects.

{"text": "Banning cars from the centre of various cities around the world has been a strategy to reduce pollution and encourage people to use public transport. It has had various positive effects for both individuals and for society as a whole.Banning cars from the centre of cities seems to be a very positive development. Fewer cars on the road means less pollution and fewer fossil fuel resources being used up. Although the effect on resources might be relatively negligible, it can create a newer way of thinking regarding the dynamics of transport within cities and this could be the most important benefit to society. Some people working in the centre of these cities may complain about inconvenience, but many would agree that this is a small price to pay.A reduction in the reliance of people on private vehicles is likely to encourage them to use public transport or even bicycles. Using public transport, especially the types that run on clean sources of power, will significantly raise air quality levels in cities, which will of course benefit everyone. The clean air could even further encourage the use of bicycles, which would in turn promote more healthy lifestyles and less obesity. This would contribute on an individual level to people's well-being and a better and longer life, and on a societal level, it would lessen the strain on public health resources. Governments could encourage this by creating more bicycle lanes to make cycling easier and safer.In conclusion, it is clear that banning cars from the centre of cities is significantly beneficial. Better health and ecology, as well as improvement in longevity and well-being can benefit individuals and the entire society.", "label": "human", "label_int": 0, "est_prob_list": [[4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091], [4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091], [2.5427308827638626, 0.03785473645826133, 1.199823011707617, 1.1394342184066772, 1.5815075019979887, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 1.8701266665295266, 2.0649644477026805, 2.7654827432502818], [3.319413185539811, 0.06453735359015315, 0.3531031832098961, 1.610394798005693, 1.626761050289887, 4.2055098603141206, 4.605170185988091, 0.3424902558326721, 1.8242622366483672, 2.4464261680841446], [3.608398878765816, 0.010050326585769653, 0.19786228984594345, 1.1270272502836587, 0.9162907004356384, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 0.5630182888229174, 1.6894340790179816, 1.7736899554729462], [0.0813456394539524, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 2.111190239994416, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 2.0794415416798357, 2.1439800628174073, 0.33024168687057687], [0.16989903679539747, 4.1588830833596715, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 3.4657359027997265, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 3.7534179752515073, 0.4953214372300254, 0.3194307707663612]], "target_roberta_idx": [72, 96, 98, 106, 107, 114, 147, 151, 266, 283], "target_prob_idx": [66, 90, 92, 100, 101, 108, 139, 143, 256, 271]}
{"text": "The question is about how to improve the quality of life in a city by increasing the number of people who can afford to live there. The solution is not necessarily to build more housing, but rather to make it easier for people to move into the area. This will increase the supply of housing, which will reduce prices and therefore encourage more people to move there. In order to do that, you need to understand what makes a place attractive to potential residents. You also need to know how to attract them. In other words, you need to be able to talk about the things that make a place desirable to potential residents. For example, if you want to attract young professionals to a city, you might say something like \"the food is great here\" or \"there's lots of good music venues\". If you want to attract older people, you might say something like \"it has beautiful parks and nice restaurants\". If you're talking about attracting new immigrants, you could say something like \"you'll find a lot of ethnic diversity here\", or \"this city has a very strong sense of community\". This is an excellent way to get started with writing an essay. It gives you a clear idea of what you're trying to achieve and why you think it will work.

{"text": "The taxi industry is one that has been around since ancient times, but it was not until recently when they became more popular than ever before. This can be seen in many ways; firstly there were no roads back then so people had to walk everywhere which meant they needed transport as well. Secondly with the invention of the car came the need for a means of transporting them safely. The third reason why we see an increase in the number of cabs now compared to years ago is because of the rise in population. There are more people living in big cities like London and New York than there used to be. As these places become bigger and busier, the demand for cab services increases too. It's also important to note that the government does not regulate how much you pay per mile driven by the driver. So if he drives fast, charges high prices and takes longer routes, he will make money regardless of what happens to his passengers. In addition to all this, the drivers themselves benefit greatly from having their own vehicles. They get paid every time someone uses their service instead of waiting for customers to come to them. For example, if I am going somewhere far away, I would rather take a cab than wait for public transportation. If I do decide to use the latter, I might end up spending hours trying to find my way home.

This trend has sparked a heated debate on whether this is a positive or negative development. In my opinion, this development is a positive one, with both individual and societal benefits. On the individual level, the absence of private cars in these areas leads to a cleaner and healthier environment. With fewer cars on the road, the air quality improves, and residents can enjoy a more peaceful and quieter living space. This is particularly important for urban dwellers, who are often exposed to high levels of pollution and noise. Moreover, the lack of parking spaces and traffic congestion discourages car ownership, which can be a significant financial burden for many people. As a result, residents in these areas are more likely to use public transportation, walk, or cycle, which can improve their physical health and overall well-being. On the societal level, the absence of private cars in certain areas can have numerous benefits. For instance, it promotes the use of public transportation, which can reduce traffic congestion and improve the overall efficiency of the transportation system. This, in turn, can lead to increased productivity and economic growth, as people can get to their destinations more quickly and efficiently.

This trend has sparked a heated debate among city planners, environmentalists, and commuters alike. While some argue that this is a positive development, others believe that it has more negative effects. In this essay, I will examine both sides of the argument and provide my own perspective on the matter. On the one hand, proponents of this trend argue that it has several positive effects. Firstly, it reduces traffic congestion, which is a major problem in many cities. By limiting the number of private cars on the road, taxis and buses can move more efficiently, leading to shorter travel times and reduced pollution. Secondly, it encourages people to use public transportation, which can lead to a decrease in the number of cars on the road and a reduction in carbon emissions. Finally, it provides a more reliable and convenient transportation option for people who do not own cars, such as the elderly, disabled, and low-income individuals. However, opponents of this trend argue that it has several negative effects. Firstly, it limits people's freedom of movement, as they are forced to rely on taxis and buses for transportation. This can be particularly problematic for people who live in areas where public transportation is limited or unreliable.

{"text": "In recent years, many cities have implemented areas where only taxis and buses are allowed, effectively restricting private vehicles. This development has both positive and negative consequences for individuals and society. On one hand, the restriction of private vehicles in certain areas can have several positive impacts. Firstly, it helps to reduce traffic congestion. With fewer private cars on the roads, there is less congestion, resulting in smoother traffic flow and shorter travel times. This is particularly beneficial in densely populated urban areas where traffic congestion is a persistent problem. Secondly, it can lead to improved air quality. Private vehicles are a major source of air pollution, emitting harmful gases and particulate matter. By limiting their presence, the air quality in these areas can be significantly improved, leading to better health outcomes for residents. Lastly, by promoting the use of public transport, it encourages sustainable transportation options and reduces the overall carbon footprint of the city. However, there are also negative effects associated with this development. One major drawback is the inconvenience it may cause for individuals who rely on private vehicles for their daily commute. For those who live outside the restricted areas, they would need to park their vehicles at the outskirts and rely on public transport to reach their destinations.

{"text": "The implementation of zones in urban areas where only certain types of vehicles, such as taxis and buses, are allowed has become an increasingly popular measure to tackle various environmental and social issues. While such a development has its drawbacks, I believe it is largely beneficial for both individuals and society as a whole. A primary advantage of restricting private car access in city centres is the reduction of traffic congestion. In cities where space is at a premium, streets can become clogged with vehicles, leading to long travel times and reduced productivity. By prioritizing buses and taxis, which carry more passengers per vehicle, the number of cars on the road decreases, enabling a smoother flow of traffic. For example, in London, the introduction of bus-only lanes has significantly increased the speed of bus travel, making public transport a more attractive option for commuters. Furthermore, limiting car access in certain areas can lead to a substantial decrease in air pollution. Automobiles are major contributors to urban air quality problems, releasing pollutants that can cause respiratory issues and other health problems. By encouraging the use of public transport, cities can reduce emissions, leading to cleaner air. This was observed in Copenhagen, where pedestrian zones have contributed to a marked improvement in air quality. On an individual level, such policies can encourage healthier lifestyles. With fewer cars, cities often become more pedestrian and cyclist-friendly, prompting residents to walk or bike rather than drive. This not only has positive implications for physical health but also for mental well-being, as active commuting has been linked to reduced stress levels.", "label": "gpt-4-1106-preview", "label_int": 7, "est_prob_list": [[4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091], [3.912022829055786, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 3.2188756465911865, 3.2188756465911865, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091], [0.030459178611636162, 1.9140186309814453, 0.41551530361175537, 2.0402209758758545, 2.0402209758758545, 3.9120230674743652, 0.02020268701016903, 1.8971198797225952, 0.06187540665268898, 0.0], [0.3424903452396393, 4.450103998184204, 0.2876819968223572, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 3.016143321990967, 0.3710636794567108, 2.1202635765075684, 0.02020268701016903, 0.040822017937898636], [0.09431064873933792, 2.2655447210584367, 0.5108255743980408, 0.7985077500343323, 0.7985077500343323, 4.605170185988091, 0.06187540665268898, 1.469675898551941, 0.040822017937898636, 0.0], [3.912023005428146, 4.1588830833596715, 0.43318965612301924, 0.27217788591581565, 1.6950298427695039, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 1.4343035803062512, 4.446565155811453, 0.06871389254805181], [4.605170185988091, 3.7534179752515073, 0.48258241145259567, 0.4632670259375522, 0.49395899253056885, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 0.5212969236332861, 3.0602707946915624, 0.0017623774689409216]], "target_roberta_idx": [37, 70, 72, 120, 121, 127, 134, 265, 276, 277], "target_prob_idx": [36, 69, 71, 117, 118, 124, 131, 259, 268, 269]}

{"text": "Ketamine is a dissociative anesthetic that has been used for decades as an adjunct to psychotherapy. It works by blocking the reuptake of serotonin, which in turn blocks the release of norepinephrine and dopamine from nerve cells. This causes the brain to flood with these neurotransmitters, causing intense feelings of euphoria and relaxation. Ketamine also increases the amount of glutamate released into the synapse, which can cause long-lasting memory loss. In addition, ketamine's ability to block the reuptake of serotonin and norepinephrine may be responsible for its antidepressant effects. In clinical trials, patients treated with ketamine experienced significant improvements in their PTSD symptoms. The most common side effect was nausea, but it could last up to 24 hours. Patients who were taking other medications or had severe anxiety disorders were at increased risk of developing seizures while on ketamine.

There have not yet been any large randomized controlled trials with long term follow up; however, early data suggest that patients treated with intravenous infusions show significant improvement after just one or two treatments.", "label": "gpt-j-6b", "label_int": 2, "est_prob_list": [[3.2188758850097656, 3.5065577030181885, 3.5065579414367676, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 3.0161432027816772, 4.57674620368264, 3.9120230674743652], [2.3025851249694824, 2.6592600345611572, 3.2188756465911865, 1.56064772605896, 1.56064772605896, 3.912022829055786, 3.2188756465911865, 2.292683780193329, 2.6554046300324528, 4.605170185988091], [0.15358441770076753, 4.605170185988091, 1.6094379425048828, 4.605170185988091, 2.0402207374572754, 0.994966521859169, 2.525728464126587, 3.5065579414367676, 3.204419352791526, 0.8624243289232254], [0.2817383736371994, 4.605170185988091, 1.1394343376159668, 3.9120230674743652, 2.6592600345611572, 0.8201793134212494, 0.9162907004356384, 0.9162906408309937, 4.353116729042747, 1.103637456893921], [0.03475185930728912, 2.9124317850385393, 1.2378742694854736, 3.912022829055786, 2.6592600345611572, 0.3011050820350647, 4.605170185988091, 2.207274913787842, 4.605170185988091, 1.6195392860099673], [0.39768296766610944, 2.3263016196113617, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 3.0602707946915624, 0.6251965186514375, 2.2129729343043585, 0.23197146543777514, 2.6548056865833978, 3.347952867143343], [0.6035350218702582, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 3.242592351485517, 2.2129729343043585, 2.906120114864304, 0.179201429457711, 2.367123614131617, 3.7534179752515073]], "target_roberta_idx": [30, 86, 98, 107, 108, 117, 124, 129, 135, 142], "target_prob_idx": [24, 76, 88, 97, 98, 107, 114, 119, 123, 130]}

Reduces hyperarousal: Ketamine has been shown to decrease the activity of the brain's \"fight or flight\" response, which is hyperactivated in individuals with PTSD. This can lead to a reduction in symptoms such as anxiety, agitation, and irritability. 2. Enhances synaptic plasticity: Ketamine has been found to increase the release of a protein called brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), which is involved in the formation and maintenance of synaptic connections in the brain. This can help improve the consolidation of memories and reduce the impact of traumatic memories on the brain. 3. Inhibits the return of fear memories: Ketamine has been shown to inhibit the reconsolidation of fear memories, which can lead to a reduction in the frequency and intensity of flashbacks and nightmares. 4.", "label": "Llama-2-13b-chat-hf", "label_int": 3, "est_prob_list": [[4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 2.8460399955511093, 4.055864095687866, 3.5065579414367676, 3.2188758850097656, 3.150690549612045], [3.2834028720855715, 3.314769903818766, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 2.995732307434082, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 2.3025851249694824, 4.605170185988091, 2.809286890551448], [0.0, 0.0, 0.05913948470619344, 0.09805335484227293, 0.6685888147862161, 0.22581417113542557, 0.0, 0.0, 0.010050326585769653, 0.024750162661075593], [0.0, 0.0, 1.5202157912509782, 3.5065579414367676, 4.605170185988091, 0.1900583803653717, 0.0, 0.0, 0.7765287756919861, 0.8768054842948914], [0.01667630523443222, 0.0, 0.36845003281320843, 0.7339692115783691, 4.605170185988091, 0.19336383417248726, 0.0, 0.0, 0.051293306052684784, 0.06032915115356445], [0.33024168687057687, 4.605170185988091, 0.4953214372300254, 1.1884686177899708, 4.605170185988091, 3.147282171681192, 1.6133518117552368, 0.415278729556489, 3.5992672954242493, 2.9802280870180256], [2.5494451709255714, 4.605170185988091, 0.6325225587435105, 2.367123614131617, 4.605170185988091, 3.242592351485517, 0.7915872533731978, 0.09844007281325252, 2.5494451709255714, 1.4180430594344708]], "target_roberta_idx": [30, 31, 55, 57, 71, 107, 108, 109, 136, 209], "target_prob_idx": [23, 24, 45, 47, 57, 91, 92, 93, 116, 181]}

{"text": "Ketamine infusion therapy has shown promise in addressing the specific symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). PTSD is a mental health condition that can occur after experiencing or witnessing a traumatic event, and it is characterized by symptoms such as intrusive thoughts, nightmares, flashbacks, anxiety, and depression. Ketamine is a dissociative anesthetic that has been used for decades in medical and veterinary settings. In recent years, it has gained attention for its potential therapeutic effects on mental health conditions, including PTSD. One way ketamine infusion therapy addresses the symptoms of PTSD is by modulating the brain's glutamate system. Glutamate is an excitatory neurotransmitter that plays a role in memory formation and emotional regulation. In individuals with PTSD, there is often an imbalance in glutamate levels, leading to hyperactive fear responses and difficulty in extinguishing traumatic memories. Ketamine works by blocking N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors, which are involved in the regulation of glutamate. By doing so, ketamine helps regulate glutamate levels and disrupts the fear memory consolidation process.", "label": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "label_int": 6, "est_prob_list": [[4.605170185988091, 3.308515821184431, 4.605170185988091, 3.504960651199023, 3.5817990832858615, 3.9120230674743652, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091], [3.4714377721150718, 2.899597372327532, 3.9120230674743652, 3.804791846209102, 3.0426844225989447, 3.2188758850097656, 2.948565642038981, 1.6620375216007233, 1.7728400230407715, 1.8917316496372223], [0.0, 0.06533047716532435, 0.40135201811790466, 1.536520656819145, 0.2675495147705078, 4.605170185988091, 0.0, 0.20698268339037895, 2.4079456329345703, 1.945847471555074], [0.0, 0.40879107053790775, 1.3203343152999878, 1.1631164617008634, 0.03978158699141608, 4.605170185988091, 0.008978972004519569, 1.5987092051655054, 3.9120230674743652, 4.605170185988091], [0.0, 0.2524221305336271, 0.8063280085722605, 0.727377368344201, 0.19688408904605442, 4.605170185988091, 0.0, 0.13796454202383757, 3.5065579414367676, 2.9093047380447388], [6.44669430524975e-05, 0.5753641449035618, 0.35826846310549115, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 1.2411123512753928, 4.605170185988091, 0.07985069424665803, 0.8121660886626648, 2.2129729343043585], [0.179201429457711, 0.6325225587435105, 2.772588722239781, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 1.0018826622095587, 4.605170185988091, 2.906120114864304, 0.7248958788745256, 2.018816919863401]], "target_roberta_idx": [29, 109, 111, 122, 125, 166, 201, 207, 212, 213], "target_prob_idx": [23, 98, 100, 110, 113, 148, 172, 178, 182, 183]}
{"text": "Ketamine infusion therapy is an emerging treatment for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) that is being explored for its rapid and significant effects on reducing symptoms. Ketamine is a dissociative anesthetic that, at lower doses, has been found to have antidepressant and anti-anxiety properties. Its mechanism of action in treating PTSD includes: 1. NMDA receptor antagonism: Ketamine blocks the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors in the brain, which is thought to modulate the glutamatergic system. This modulation can lead to changes in synaptic plasticity and the strengthening of synapses in areas of the brain involved in mood and emotional regulation. 2. Increase in Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF): Ketamine can stimulate the release of BDNF, which plays a critical role in neuroplasticity-the brain's ability to reorganize and form new neural connections. This may aid in the recovery of areas affected by the chronic stress of PTSD. 3. Reduction in symptoms: Patients with PTSD often experience intrusive thoughts, hyperarousal, and avoidance behaviors.", "label": "gpt-4-1106-preview", "label_int": 7, "est_prob_list": [[4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091], [4.605170185988091, 2.6592600345611572, 3.912022829055786, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 3.393593195360154, 2.813410758972168, 4.605170185988091], [0.6161860823631287, 0.9925994724035263, 0.01709776868422826, 0.02020268701016903, 0.012204940989613533, 0.0, 0.20582757890224457, 0.07527627050876617, 0.0, 0.0], [1.9661128520965576, 1.051673948764801, 3.6317544355988503, 0.4620353579521179, 0.3358862280845642, 0.045007082633674145, 1.1355957090854645, 0.18349230289459229, 0.0, 0.013537412716282738], [0.6348782181739807, 0.4670533910393715, 0.5777389854192734, 0.08338159322738647, 0.3106114983558655, 0.01697746547870338, 0.4085453152656555, 0.1449546217918396, 0.0, 0.0], [4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 0.9500575943449725, 2.367123614131617, 4.605170185988091, 1.9616585060234524, 1.2547180033311713, 4.605170185988091, 0.3577916386388075, 0.3087354816496133], [0.3359879820305943, 3.242592351485517, 1.1631508098056809, 0.009981286148634288, 2.906120114864304, 3.7534179752515073, 1.8562979903656263, 4.1588830833596715, 1.1631508098056809, 0.0004019682411469557]], "target_roberta_idx": [72, 80, 126, 132, 133, 146, 173, 208, 218, 231], "target_prob_idx": [58, 64, 94, 99, 100, 113, 133, 162, 172, 182]}
{"text": "/u/JoeGrinstead is right about the contractual reason it was rebooted with Andrew Garfield but I want to touch in the popularity aspect. When it comes to comic books, Spider-Man is royalty, ranking with Batman and Superman in the pop-culture consciousness. Ask a 40 year old whose never seen a movie or picked up a comic and they can still probably tell you, \"Oh he's bitten by a radioactive spider\" or \"with great power comes great responsibility. This comes in part from the fact that Spidey has long had a huge presence off the page. The '60s and '90s cartoons were very popular. The 2000 movie also set box office records with its openings. It's one of few comics that financially has enough readers to maintain multiple comics at once. At one point in the '90s, The Amazing Spider-Man, The Spectacular Spider-Man, the Sensational Spider-Man, Web of Spider-Man, and just vanilla Spider-Man were all concurrent, ongoing titles.

{"text": "Because they're not good. Spider-Man is one of those characters that has been around for a long time, and he's had many different incarnations over the years. He was originally created by Stan Lee in 1962 as part of Marvel Comics' line of superhero titles called The Amazing Adventures Of... series (which also included Thor). In this first incarnation, Peter Parker was an average high school student who happened to have superpowers after getting bitten by a radioactive spider while on vacation with his Aunt May. His powers were limited at first - he could only stretch out his arms like Superman or fly like Batman. But eventually, he gained more abilities, including webbing from which he could shoot webs, turn into a giant spider form, etc. This version of Spidey would go through several changes before finally becoming what we know today. The original Spider-Man comic book character debuted in 1963, but it wasn't until 1967 when Marvel introduced their own version of him. That version didn't last very long either; just three issues later, the title was cancelled due to low sales.", "label": "gpt-j-6b", "label_int": 2, "est_prob_list": [[4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 3.6395073413848875, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 3.5065579414367676, 3.912022829055786, 4.22008834944831, 4.605170185988091], [3.9120230674743652, 2.4079456329345703, 3.0671130180358888, 4.605170185988091, 2.525728702545166, 2.667965436975161, 4.605170185988091, 3.5065579414367676, 3.0706338352627225, 2.525728702545166], [3.2383182843526206, 1.36959732696414, 0.0650075614452362, 4.605170185988091, 0.04082195460796356, 0.15875722964604697, 4.605170185988091, 1.7147983312606812, 2.635376294453939, 4.605170185988091], [2.525728702545166, 1.9944814145565033, 1.1982928276062013, 3.912022829055786, 0.2231435328722, 0.12254191603925493, 4.605170185988091, 2.0402207374572754, 2.924640655517578, 4.605170185988091], [2.260350545247396, 1.382514365017414, 0.15426498651504517, 4.605170185988091, 0.010050326585769653, 0.0247611277219322, 4.605170185988091, 0.9162907004356384, 1.9255917337205675, 4.605170185988091], [3.4657359027997265, 3.242592351485517, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 3.9357395320454622, 1.6950298427695039, 0.6035350218702582, 4.605170185988091, 0.47627324225933093], [3.0602707946915624, 2.906120114864304, 4.605170185988091, 1.7609878105613013, 3.7534179752515073, 3.4657359027997265, 1.4508328822574619, 1.2144441041932315, 1.2966822024302034, 1.4847344339331432]], "target_roberta_idx": [103, 134, 135, 139, 146, 176, 183, 212, 213, 214], "target_prob_idx": [99, 129, 130, 134, 141, 167, 174, 203, 204, 205]}
{"text": "The Spider-Man movies have been rebooted several times over the past two decades, with three different actors playing the web-slinging superhero in just the past 15 years. There are several reasons why the franchise is constantly being rebooted. One reason is the changing landscape of the film industry. With the rise of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), the superhero genre has become increasingly popular, and studios are looking for ways to cash in on the trend. Rebooting a beloved franchise like Spider-Man allows studios to reintroduce the character to a new generation of fans and capitalize on the current popularity of superhero movies. Another reason for the constant reboots is the desire to update the story and characters to reflect current sensibilities and trends. Each new iteration of Spider-Man brings a fresh take on the character and his world, allowing filmmakers to explore new themes and ideas. For example, the latest reboot, Spider-Man: No Way Home, features a more diverse cast and a more modern take on the Spider-Man mythos. Finally, the constant reboots are also driven by financial considerations. Rebooting a franchise like Spider-Man allows studios to extend the life of the franchise and continue to generate revenue from the character.", "label": "Llama-2-13b-chat-hf", "label_int": 3, "est_prob_list": [[4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 3.5065579414367676, 3.5065579414367676, 3.5065579414367676, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091], [4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 2.813410520553589, 2.630118414759636, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 2.287428956478834], [0.17809337099278472, 0.07438117762406667, 0.0, 4.605170185988091, 0.16251890361309052, 0.030459178611636162, 0.004531615711100381, 0.18632960319519043, 0.3955522407406111, 0.0], [0.6539263725280762, 0.22467567523320517, 0.0, 4.605170185988091, 2.3025851249694824, 0.11653383076190948, 0.04480495397001505, 1.2039728164672852, 2.207274913787842, 0.02020268701016903], [0.46203547716140747, 0.17431794479489326, 0.0, 4.605170185988091, 2.1202635765075684, 0.4462871253490448, 0.07438118755817413, 1.5141277313232422, 0.8209805488586426, 0.0], [4.605170185988091, 3.347952867143343, 0.7168637071772613, 3.4657359027997265, 0.9704664659761797, 0.4700036292457356, 2.5494451709255714, 0.5082248420659333, 1.2411123512753928, 3.0602707946915624], [2.906120114864304, 2.772588722239781, 0.9400072584914712, 4.605170185988091, 0.27731928541623435, 1.3862943611198906, 2.772588722239781, 0.34117075740276714, 1.8562979903656263, 2.4541349911212467]], "target_roberta_idx": [37, 38, 53, 54, 111, 172, 173, 174, 180, 245], "target_prob_idx": [29, 30, 44, 45, 97, 155, 156, 157, 163, 219]}

Each reboot allows filmmakers to take a fresh approach to the material and adapt it to the current cultural and cinematic landscape. Additionally, reboots can provide an opportunity to address criticisms of previous iterations and to improve upon them. Another reason for the constant reboots is the changing nature of the comic book movie genre. Over the years, comic book movies have evolved from being considered niche and aimed primarily at children to being a mainstream, global phenomenon with a diverse audience. As a result, the filmmakers may want to take advantage of the current popularity and success of the genre to create a new version of Spider-Man that appeals to a wider audience. Furthermore, reboots can also be a strategic business decision. Studios may decide to reboot a franchise in order to extend its lifespan and generate more revenue.

{"text": "The Spider-Man movies have been rebooted multiple times primarily due to a combination of creative and business reasons. Here are a few key factors contributing to the constant reboots: 1. Franchise Fatigue: After the initial success of the original Spider-Man trilogy directed by Sam Raimi, the franchise experienced a decline in quality and audience interest with the release of Spider-Man 3 (2007). This led to Sony Pictures deciding to reboot the series to breathe new life into the character and attract a fresh audience. 2. Rights Issues: Sony Pictures obtained the film rights to Spider-Man in the late 1990s, and to maintain their hold on the character, they needed to release films within a certain time frame. If they failed to do so, the rights would revert back to Marvel Studios. This resulted in the hasty development of The Amazing Spider-Man series as a reboot, which was released just five years after Spider-Man 3. 3. Collaboration with Marvel Studios: In 2015, Sony Pictures and Marvel Studios struck a deal to share the film rights to Spider-Man. This agreement allowed Spider-Man to appear in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), starting with Captain America: Civil War (2016).", "label": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "label_int": 6, "est_prob_list": [[4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091], [4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 3.5065579414367676, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091], [0.1593942032860858, 0.31471070647239685, 1.211490511894226, 4.605170185988091, 0.03093770332634449, 0.06187540665268898, 0.0, 0.1984509527683258, 0.0, 0.008307048712264408], [3.617244984422411, 4.605170185988091, 1.5028105463300432, 4.605170185988091, 0.39836573135107756, 0.7765287756919861, 0.010050326585769653, 0.3011050820350647, 0.0, 0.12131433459845456], [2.984016351401806, 4.605170185988091, 0.6897591182163784, 4.605170185988091, 0.09648904111236334, 0.16251890361309052, 0.13926206529140472, 0.597836971282959, 0.0, 0.08674385872754184], [4.605170185988091, 0.21993236393896826, 0.9104484562499267, 0.19362908314008992, 0.031817864420366264, 0.6699801212784109, 0.005282368476705219, 1.6739764335716716, 3.568664667092765e-05, 0.012072370809222282], [4.605170185988091, 1.0018826622095587, 2.906120114864304, 0.6623755218931916, 0.9400072584914712, 0.9808292530117262, 0.7744928200138977, 1.114360645636249, 4.1588830833596715, 2.018816919863401]], "target_roberta_idx": [33, 36, 39, 46, 70, 71, 100, 119, 120, 167], "target_prob_idx": [29, 31, 34, 40, 60, 61, 89, 106, 107, 152]}
{"text": "The Spider-Man movies are frequently rebooted for several reasons: 1. **Rights and Studio Changes**: The film rights to Spider-Man are owned by Sony Pictures, and the character's cinematic portrayal is subject to agreements between Sony and Marvel Studios (owned by Disney). Each studio has different visions and plans for the character, leading to reboots to align with these strategies. 2. **Creative Differences and New Directions**: Filmmakers and studios often want to bring fresh perspectives to the character, exploring different storylines, villains, and themes that haven't been covered in previous films or align with current cultural trends. 3. **Financial Considerations**: Spider-Man is a highly profitable and recognizable franchise. Reboots can reinvigorate audience interest and generate significant box office returns, as new iterations often attract both loyal fans and new audiences. 4. **Casting Changes**: As actors age or choose to move on from the role, studios may opt to reboot the series with a new cast to maintain the youthful portrayal of Peter Parker/Spider-Man and to introduce new story arcs that fit the new cast. 5.", "label": "gpt-4-1106-preview", "label_int": 7, "est_prob_list": [[4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 3.62417976132461, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091], [4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 3.409465948740641, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091], [0.1306823492050171, 0.03077598363161087, 0.042317916240010946, 0.46936612638334435, 1.2245169026511056, 0.12317050605391462, 4.605170185988091, 0.0, 0.0, 0.5798184871673584], [0.5747423321008682, 1.5995761513710023, 0.8923259803227016, 0.737764298915863, 4.605170185988091, 0.08798001209894817, 2.3076102882623672, 0.0, 0.0, 4.605170185988091], [0.2231435626745224, 0.8082441329956055, 0.4276706746646336, 1.0232268075148265, 4.605170185988091, 0.2608238309621811, 4.605170185988091, 0.0, 0.0, 0.6931471824645996], [0.33024168687057687, 3.7534179752515073, 0.6548283162578087, 2.4541349911212467, 2.9802280870180256, 0.8266785731844679, 4.605170185988091, 0.6179237593223578, 3.0602707946915624, 3.7534179752515073], [0.15575946517466474, 2.2870809064580806, 0.06121354893275322, 0.1070981355563671, 0.9872804628174322, 0.8446970786871463, 1.5161443380131727, 2.6548056865833978, 2.2129729343043585, 2.1439800628174073]], "target_roberta_idx": [45, 46, 47, 49, 61, 99, 198, 204, 205, 221], "target_prob_idx": [40, 41, 42, 44, 57, 93, 188, 194, 195, 207]}
{"text": "This is a pejorative statement without context. When I was doing SW estimates, I would take the software specification, break it down ionto pieces that could be more easily estimated, and, based on my own personal knowledge, would ghive an estimate. After the task was approved and started, that's when trouble began. You see, the specification cannot capture all the nuance. So the estimate has to be \"padded\". Also, the user/requestor would change the basic functions of \"just a few things\". This invalidates the estimate and ends up costing more (in almost every case). So, if you are consistently changing the requirements, you are changing the design, which changes the costs, which (in some cases) invalidates all the hard work done to get the original estimate in place.

And when you try to estimate something, there's no way to get an accurate answer unless you have some idea of how long it will take.

We have been taught since school days (and even before) that \"the more hours one works, the better\". This is wrong for many reasons, including the fact that we don't know what really happens when someone works too hard or too long. It can lead us into bad habits which may be very difficult to break later on. For example, people who get stressed out easily will often end up with high blood pressure, heart problems etc., while those who take breaks every now and then usually stay healthy.

{"text": "Software engineers may consistently underestimate the amount of work a given effort takes due to several factors: 1. **Complexity**: Software projects are often more complex than they appear at the outset. Unforeseen complexities and dependencies can emerge as the work progresses, increasing the time needed for implementation. 2. **Optimism Bias**: Engineers may be inherently optimistic about their abilities to solve problems and thus underestimate the time required to complete tasks, especially when they are familiar with the technology or the problem domain. 3. **Requirement Changes**: Requirements can evolve during the development process, especially in agile environments. These changes can lead to additional work that was not accounted for in the original estimates. 4. **Unfamiliar Technologies**: When working with new or unfamiliar technologies, engineers may not fully appreciate the learning curve or the intricacies involved, leading to overly optimistic estimates. 5.", "label": "gpt-4-1106-preview", "label_int": 7, "est_prob_list": [[4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 3.9120230674743652, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091], [4.202810704708099, 2.207274913787842, 4.605170185988091, 1.9023972272872924, 4.605170185988091, 2.0402209758758545, 2.0402209758758545, 2.0044457018375397, 2.5818548467424183, 3.016143321990967], [0.8209804892539978, 0.65195507183671, 3.5065579414367676, 4.605170185988091, 0.0, 0.5108255743980408, 0.7646739284197489, 0.6686985790729523, 2.5270009305742054, 2.1202635765075684], [0.3424903452396393, 0.9430687874555588, 3.912022829055786, 3.5065579414367676, 1.0103051662445068, 4.605170185988091, 2.097703456878662, 0.6538229435682297, 1.6670158339871302, 4.605170185988091], [1.6094379425048828, 1.4081603214144707, 2.1202635765075684, 4.605170185988091, 0.00753774493932724, 1.5141277313232422, 0.7817195057868958, 0.34359489008784294, 1.4557075434260898, 2.995732307434082], [3.9357395320454622, 1.9898293829901488, 4.605170185988091, 3.4657359027997265, 1.3555227024531369, 0.16989903679539747, 0.9913005528790216, 4.605170185988091, 2.5006550067561393, 2.8371272433773522], [4.605170185988091, 0.5717030675998905, 4.605170185988091, 0.911485398733892, 1.1384581972153094, 0.7088955375280844, 1.6331544390514163, 0.2833253649896197, 1.7609878105613013, 1.2537414445436363]], "target_roberta_idx": [31, 54, 59, 75, 92, 125, 126, 127, 139, 166], "target_prob_idx": [30, 52, 57, 72, 89, 123, 124, 125, 137, 164]}

The post was later deleted by him but not before it had been archived on 4chan and Reddit. It was then picked up by other sites such as Kotaku In Action (KiA) and reddit where it quickly became one of the most discussed topics on the internet. This caused many people to start questioning the ethics of gaming journalism, especially after several high profile games journalists were accused of sexual harassment or worse. Many gamers felt that these accusations were being made out of spite for them and they wanted to see change.

However, this did not stop the second goal from being met - GamerGate continues to be active today with many members working on projects such as #NotYourShield.", "label": "gpt-j-6b", "label_int": 2, "est_prob_list": [[3.5065579414367676, 3.5065579414367676, 3.5065579414367676, 3.9460028648376464, 3.9120230674743652, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 3.7907340093092485, 4.605170185988091, 3.5065579414367676], [4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 3.6395073413848875, 2.995732069015503, 2.640801525115967, 4.605170185988091, 3.6064316792921587, 3.2188758850097656, 3.5065579414367676], [2.0402209758758545, 0.12783338129520416, 1.5141276121139526, 0.0, 0.04169079661369324, 2.813410758972168, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 2.279911431399259, 0.38176917816911426], [3.5065579414367676, 1.1394342184066772, 0.5798184871673584, 0.040822017937898636, 0.25142874754965305, 2.813410758972168, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 2.037167332389138, 0.45234052198273794], [3.9120230674743652, 0.16251890361309052, 0.9675840139389038, 0.02020268701016903, 0.09727801661938429, 2.4079456329345703, 3.9120230674743652, 2.382917360825972, 0.827639406377619, 0.2829557689172881], [2.2870809064580806, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 1.7385149547092427, 3.5992672954242493, 0.2929040164329326, 3.9357395320454622, 2.2870809064580806, 2.906120114864304, 3.242592351485517], [2.772588722239781, 3.4657359027997265, 4.605170185988091, 2.1439800628174073, 4.605170185988091, 0.6035350218702582, 3.7534179752515073, 3.7534179752515073, 2.018816919863401, 3.242592351485517]], "target_roberta_idx": [41, 70, 71, 72, 73, 99, 105, 106, 109, 143], "target_prob_idx": [40, 70, 71, 72, 73, 94, 100, 101, 104, 137]}

It began with a dispute between a video game developer, Zoe Quinn, and a group of players who were unhappy with the treatment of women in her game, Depression Quest. The dispute escalated into a larger debate about sexism and misogyny in the gaming industry, as well as the role of women in gaming and the ethics of game journalism. The main issues that sparked the controversy were: 1. Zoe Quinn's game, Depression Quest, which some players and game developers felt was too focused on gender and sexuality issues, and did not provide an enjoyable gaming experience. 2. The perceived bias of certain game journalists who reviewed the game favorably, which some believed was due to their personal relationships with Quinn or her feminist views. 3.", "label": "Llama-2-13b-chat-hf", "label_int": 3, "est_prob_list": [[4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 3.8829866528511046, 3.5065579414367676, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 3.5065579414367676, 3.5065579414367676], [3.5065579414367676, 3.577451765537262, 2.6738446950912476, 3.5065579414367676, 3.4654604707445418, 3.5065579414367676, 3.2188756465911865, 3.2188756465911865, 3.5065579414367676, 3.5065579414367676], [0.0, 0.04715532436966896, 0.07765977178740227, 0.008702622460467475, 0.0, 0.5796060163576351, 1.1711829900741577, 0.29993740320205686, 0.0, 0.0], [0.010153059537212053, 0.22314351797103882, 2.809337282180786, 0.40774754115513395, 0.7765287756919861, 2.0402209758758545, 4.605170185988091, 2.0861565709114074, 0.0, 0.0], [0.0, 0.24714815616607666, 1.691196119785309, 0.10190713405609131, 0.0, 3.2188758850097656, 2.525728702545166, 0.6640611950308084, 0.02020268701016903, 0.0], [3.347952867143343, 1.6133518117552368, 0.10275973395776894, 4.605170185988091, 2.1778816144930886, 4.605170185988091, 0.24187253642048673, 4.605170185988091, 1.9616585060234524, 2.2493405784752336], [2.5494451709255714, 1.3862943611198906, 0.5082248420659333, 3.4657359027997265, 4.605170185988091, 3.7534179752515073, 0.2369097470783577, 4.1588830833596715, 2.367123614131617, 4.605170185988091]], "target_roberta_idx": [54, 57, 98, 107, 136, 140, 154, 155, 156, 157], "target_prob_idx": [52, 55, 96, 105, 134, 138, 152, 153, 154, 155]}

Some saw Gamergate as a fight for ethics in journalism, while others saw it as a defense of traditional gaming culture against progressive and inclusive forces.

Firstly, some gamers believed that certain game journalists were engaging in unethical practices, such as providing positive coverage in exchange for personal relationships or financial incentives. This led to a loss of trust in the gaming media, as gamers felt their opinions were being manipulated. However, the movement became highly contentious due to the harassment and abuse directed towards women within the gaming industry.

The controversy began when the ex-boyfriend of game developer Zoe Quinn posted a lengthy blog post accusing her of infidelity with a video game journalist, which some interpreted as a conflict of interest that led to favorable coverage of her game, \"Depression Quest.\" This accusation, despite lacking substantial evidence, was picked up by parts of the gaming community, particularly users on platforms like Reddit and 4chan, who began a campaign ostensibly aimed at exposing unethical practices in video game journalism. However, the focus of GamerGate quickly shifted.", "label": "gpt-4-1106-preview", "label_int": 7, "est_prob_list": [[4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 3.9120230674743652, 3.9120230674743652, 4.426343785391913, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091], [4.2269386649131775, 4.605170185988091, 3.811111843585968, 3.2188758850097656, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091], [0.04891913663595915, 0.0, 0.012375081330537796, 0.23083904013037682, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 0.018529242939419217, 1.0283773243427277, 2.6592600345611572, 0.1372184306383133], [0.4479293469339609, 0.03783715102407667, 0.03726592063903809, 0.883782185614109, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 0.15852219528622097, 1.3430957992871602, 2.207274913787842, 1.1563176959753036], [0.02020268701016903, 0.008978972004519569, 0.016676318645477296, 0.4943014234304428, 3.912022829055786, 3.912022829055786, 0.010050326585769653, 0.8588669300079346, 2.1202633380889893, 0.31819438468664885], [0.1070981355563671, 0.6931471805599453, 3.912023005428146, 0.16989903679539747, 4.605170185988091, 0.6325225587435105, 4.605170185988091, 0.4093790074293007, 3.7534179752515073, 0.179201429457711], [0.2369097470783577, 1.6331544390514163, 4.605170185988091, 0.42121346507630353, 3.0211137198144633, 0.5854983054355701, 4.1588830833596715, 0.17024430137719462, 1.7522083803182402, 0.179201429457711]], "target_roberta_idx": [32, 45, 114, 119, 132, 133, 134, 137, 138, 154], "target_prob_idx": [30, 43, 108, 113, 126, 127, 128, 131, 132, 147]}
{"text": "By artificially devaluing the Yuan, it made gave all other currencies strong buying power within China, it made exporting labour to and buying goods from China much cheaper and more profitable for the US, Europe, etc. At the expense of labour laws and humanitarian issues it went in China's favour as it was essentially the pouring of foreign currency into the Chinese economy which then wasn't redistributed to the world because China didn't need to import things from elsewhere, and also had very harsh import taxes and such. As to how it affects gold, the Chinese have been buying large quantities of gold, or it seems that way to the gold market, because their own currency isn't backed by gold (a more universally accepted form of monetary worth) this shocked a large number of people into thinking that it was a currency back up, and seeing as the Yuan is so weak it would reflect that in the worth of Chinese gold. In reality the gold isn't for money at all, their economy is so huge it couldn't be sufficiently backed by all the gold in the world, as more and more people realise that the gold they have been buying is for products and research and all sorts of other stuff, gold prices return to normal. :) Hope this helped.", "label": "human", "label_int": 0, "est_prob_list": [[4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.144653224945069, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091], [4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 3.229299020767212, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091], [1.635109855578496, 4.605170185988091, 0.19141460281389217, 4.605170185988091, 2.3025851249694824, 2.946444070840079, 2.3483459440067858, 3.1265766180997554, 2.35631097311343, 4.605170185988091], [1.7243868020864634, 4.605170185988091, 0.1278333067893982, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 2.6592600345611572, 4.605170185988091, 3.5245306837029426, 3.9120230674743652, 4.605170185988091], [1.2512400700495794, 3.9120230674743652, 0.6039842020024356, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 2.525728464126587, 2.407945394515991, 2.525728702545166, 4.605170185988091], [4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 0.2876820724517809, 1.6133518117552368, 4.605170185988091, 3.242592351485517, 4.605170185988091, 4.1588830833596715, 0.5212969236332861, 2.6548056865833978], [4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 0.7248958788745256, 2.367123614131617, 4.605170185988091, 3.242592351485517, 4.605170185988091, 4.1588830833596715, 0.5082248420659333, 1.7165360479904674]], "target_roberta_idx": [75, 94, 113, 121, 124, 149, 177, 179, 204, 232], "target_prob_idx": [73, 92, 111, 119, 122, 147, 175, 177, 202, 230]}
{"text": "The Chinese government has been trying to get the yuan accepted as a reserve currency for years, and they have had some success. The problem is that the US dollar is still the world's reserve currency, so if China wants to use the yuan as a reserve currency, then it needs to be used in conjunction with other currencies. This means that the yuan will need to appreciate relative to other currencies. In fact, the Chinese government has already started doing this by increasing its holdings of foreign exchange reserves (see chart below). As I mentioned above, the Chinese government has also been buying up gold in recent months, which should help support the value of the Yuan. However, there are two problems with this strategy. First, the Chinese government is not really interested in controlling the price of gold. Second, the Chinese government is not really interested in keeping the value of their currency stable. If the Chinese government were truly interested in stabilizing the value of the Yuan, then it would not be purchasing gold at all. Instead, it would be selling dollars or euros to buy gold.

{"text": "It has not achieved anything. The Chinese are still buying US Treasuries and other assets in exchange for their currency, which is why they have to keep pumping money into the system to prevent a collapse of confidence. This will continue until China runs out of dollars or the Fed decides that enough is enough and stops printing them. At this point, we can expect another crash as people realize that there's no way to get more paper money printed at any rate. In fact, I think we're already seeing some signs of panic on Wall Street with all these bank failures. If you look closely, most banks were actually insolvent when Lehman failed (they had too much debt relative to equity). Now they've been bailed out by the government so they don't fail but they also haven't paid back what they borrowed from the FDIC yet. So now they need even more cash than before. But if the Fed keeps printing money like crazy, then eventually everyone else will be forced to print money too because they'll run out of places to park their excess liquidity.

{"text": "Devaluing the Yuan against the dollar, also known as currency depreciation, is a monetary policy tool used by China to boost its exports and attract foreign investment. By reducing the value of the Yuan, Chinese goods become cheaper for foreign buyers, making them more competitive in the global market. This can help to increase China's exports and support its economic growth. The devaluation of the Yuan also has an impact on gold prices. As the value of the Yuan decreases, gold, which is typically priced in dollars, becomes more expensive for Chinese investors. This can lead to an increase in demand for gold, as investors seek a safe-haven asset to protect their wealth from inflation and currency fluctuations. However, the impact of the Yuan devaluation on gold prices is not always straightforward. In 2015, when China devalued the Yuan, gold prices initially fell as the move was seen as a sign of a weaker Chinese economy, which can reduce demand for safe-haven assets like gold. However, as the devaluation continued, gold prices began to recover as investors became more risk-averse and sought safe-haven assets. In conclusion, devaluing the Yuan against the dollar can have a complex impact on gold prices, and investors should carefully consider the underlying economic factors and market conditions before making any investment decisions.", "label": "Llama-2-13b-chat-hf", "label_int": 3, "est_prob_list": [[4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 3.912022829055786, 4.605170185988091, 3.9120230674743652, 4.605170185988091], [4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 2.678255637486776, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 2.813410758972168, 4.605170185988091, 3.7092905044555664, 2.424826890230179], [0.7439190446089367, 0.0, 4.605170185988091, 0.0, 0.3290704882087254, 1.9661128520965576, 0.5010674322655174, 0.061132320982998804, 0.0, 0.37850199630054493], [2.1791549772024155, 0.020470385750134785, 4.605170185988091, 0.03419553736845652, 1.103637456893921, 2.207274913787842, 3.012694977223873, 0.4084489643573761, 0.0, 1.7147983312606812], [1.0139941293746233, 0.00854888434211413, 4.605170185988091, 0.0, 0.42198503017425537, 0.8439700603485107, 2.3410186171531677, 0.11963645368814468, 0.0, 1.1711828708648682], [1.881615798349916, 0.5684437020589881, 0.08985632912186105, 4.605170185988091, 1.1263368366829645, 0.33569129163814154, 2.5006550067561393, 1.881615798349916, 2.7119641004233466, 0.8446970786871463], [1.2411123512753928, 0.7088955375280844, 0.14250006260728304, 1.7609878105613013, 0.7915872533731978, 0.2369097470783577, 0.6931471805599453, 2.2870809064580806, 3.0602707946915624, 1.5939337258981352]], "target_roberta_idx": [33, 81, 116, 186, 187, 188, 193, 205, 224, 229], "target_prob_idx": [30, 77, 112, 178, 179, 180, 183, 194, 208, 212]}
{"text": "Devaluing the Yuan against the dollar refers to a deliberate action taken by the Chinese government to reduce the value of the Yuan in terms of the US dollar. This can be done through a variety of methods, such as adjusting exchange rate policies or intervening in the foreign exchange market. The primary objective of devaluing the Yuan against the dollar is to make Chinese exports more competitive in international markets. When the Yuan is devalued, Chinese goods become cheaper for buyers in other countries, which can lead to an increase in demand for Chinese products and a corresponding increase in exports. This can be particularly beneficial for Chinese manufacturers who rely heavily on exports to drive revenue growth. However, devaluing the Yuan can also have negative consequences. For example, it can lead to a decrease in the purchasing power of the Yuan for Chinese consumers, as imports become more expensive. Additionally, it can lead to a decrease in the value of Chinese assets, such as stocks and bonds, as investors may become less confident in the Chinese economy. In terms of gold rates, devaluing the Yuan against the dollar can have a complex effect. On one hand, a weaker Yuan may lead to an increase in demand for gold, as Chinese investors seek to hedge against inflation and protect their wealth.", "label": "vicuna-13b-v1.5", "label_int": 4, "est_prob_list": [[3.9154111317225864, 4.1064328625798225, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 3.912022829055786, 3.755078451974051, 3.342934949057443], [4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 3.2188756465911865, 4.506149189812796, 3.5470686980656216], [0.051293306052684784, 0.010050326585769653, 0.07257068157196045, 2.5, 0.0, 0.0, 1.5736702582133668, 0.025900737899872992, 0.15082287788391113, 1.5387126037052699], [1.1330823387418474, 0.12783338129520416, 3.9120230674743652, 1.1512925624847412, 0.02020268701016903, 0.02020268701016903, 3.1030287061418806, 1.531041185061137, 0.6931470632553101, 0.5760173201560974], [0.043030454805953286, 0.008379419131732308, 0.06497935014887464, 0.15991708320997317, 0.0, 0.0, 0.6441679639475686, 0.018448973595582924, 0.17435342073440552, 0.41660908422256976], [3.347952867143343, 1.102526187989246, 0.09413899091386191, 2.2129729343043585, 0.1070981355563671, 0.07290677080808779, 3.347952867143343, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 1.807507826196194], [4.1588830833596715, 1.5939337258981352, 0.33024168687057687, 0.808978996085067, 0.2076393647782445, 0.1980699137620938, 2.772588722239781, 4.605170185988091, 2.772588722239781, 3.7534179752515073]], "target_roberta_idx": [58, 59, 69, 70, 156, 157, 199, 208, 239, 247], "target_prob_idx": [55, 56, 65, 66, 150, 151, 193, 202, 232, 240]}

It can help boost exports by making the country's goods and services cheaper for foreign buyers. A weaker currency can also attract foreign investment as it makes assets in that country relatively cheaper. Additionally, devaluing the currency can help to reduce trade imbalances by making imports more expensive and encouraging domestic consumption. When it comes to gold rates, the relationship with currency devaluation is not straightforward. Gold is often seen as a safe-haven asset, and its value tends to rise during times of uncertainty or economic instability. In some cases, a devalued currency can lead to higher gold prices as investors look for alternatives to safeguard their wealth. This is because a weaker currency erodes the purchasing power of individuals, making them turn to gold as a store of value. However, the relationship between currency devaluation and gold rates can be influenced by various factors. For instance, if a country devalues its currency to boost exports, it may lead to a stronger dollar. Since gold is priced in dollars, a stronger dollar can put downward pressure on gold prices.

Regarding the impact on gold rates, the relationship can be multifaceted: 1. **Currency Devaluation and Inflation Concerns**: Devaluation of the yuan can lead to concerns about inflation, which might increase demand for gold as a hedge against inflation. 2.", "label": "gpt-4-1106-preview", "label_int": 7, "est_prob_list": [[4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.170501006974114, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091], [4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 3.5359794894854226, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091], [0.0, 4.605170185988091, 0.03512017180522283, 0.21072103083133698, 0.9434120357036591, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 2.655808873474598, 4.605170185988091, 0.16251890361309052], [0.0, 4.605170185988091, 0.5310484928389391, 1.309333324432373, 4.163110256195068, 3.5191380182902017, 3.5817990832858615, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 1.5141276121139526], [0.0, 4.605170185988091, 0.03512017180522283, 0.22314368188381195, 2.227787127097448, 4.374121189117432, 3.5817990832858615, 0.5760765895247459, 4.605170185988091, 1.1394342184066772], [0.4889316391312544, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.446565155811453, 4.1588830833596715, 1.3256697393034558, 2.8371272433773522, 0.5082248420659333, 0.2929040164329326], [1.418440502330584e-05, 4.605170185988091, 3.7534179752515073, 0.20687369759817004, 0.6006657766031859, 2.0794415416798357, 0.6776429940239801, 4.605170185988091, 0.28816363683244767, 0.08797559470880896]], "target_roberta_idx": [25, 43, 45, 140, 168, 203, 204, 219, 220, 227], "target_prob_idx": [23, 41, 45, 135, 163, 194, 195, 207, 208, 215]}

{"text": "Humans select for traits that are beneficial to them. This is the same as selecting for traits that increase their fitness, or reproductive success. The process of selective breeding has been used since ancient times and continues today in many parts of the world. Selective breeding can be done by artificial selection (i.e., through human intervention) or natural selection (i.e., without human interference). In both cases, a breeder selects which individuals have desirable characteristics based on some criteria and then breeds from those selected individuals to produce offspring with even more desirable characteristics. For example, if you want your dog to be big and strong, you might choose an individual who already has these qualities and mate it with another dog whose parents also had these qualities. If this mating produces puppies with bigger muscles than average, you will end up with dogs that look like they were bred specifically for size and strength.", "label": "gpt-j-6b", "label_int": 2, "est_prob_list": [[3.5065579414367676, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 3.9120230674743652, 4.605170185988091], [4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 2.6592600345611572, 2.6592600345611572, 3.0528212070465086, 1.7438021898269653, 2.407945394515991, 1.56064772605896, 4.605170185988091, 3.2188756465911865], [0.8675004839897156, 4.605170185988091, 2.3025851249694824, 1.1360337734222412, 0.0, 0.4944961468378703, 4.605170185988091, 0.9880815893411636, 0.6738599389791489, 0.070240318775177], [0.7985076308250427, 1.4972497940063476, 3.2188756465911865, 0.7295914122036525, 0.0, 0.461256484190623, 2.525728702545166, 1.1769390646368265, 0.5002393648028374, 0.21797549724578857], [0.43078285455703735, 2.593688130378723, 2.6592600345611572, 2.128655127116612, 0.0, 0.39008907477060956, 2.0402209758758545, 0.7398631125688553, 0.4427039623260498, 0.10490356882413228], [1.7385149547092427, 4.1588830833596715, 1.2144441041932315, 0.8912170943220391, 0.9007865453381898, 1.5748855309274405, 3.242592351485517, 2.4541349911212467, 0.9704664659761797, 4.605170185988091], [2.6548056865833978, 3.0602707946915624, 0.27731928541623435, 1.3862943611198906, 0.5212969236332861, 2.5494451709255714, 3.7534179752515073, 2.906120114864304, 2.4541349911212467, 4.605170185988091]], "target_roberta_idx": [34, 37, 68, 69, 77, 99, 108, 116, 145, 163], "target_prob_idx": [32, 35, 63, 64, 70, 92, 101, 109, 138, 156]}

{"text": "Humans selectively breed plants by intentionally choosing and crossing plants with desirable traits to create offspring with those desired traits. This process involves several steps: 1. Selection: Breeders identify plants with specific traits that they want to improve or combine. These traits can include characteristics like disease resistance, yield, size, taste, or color. 2. Cross-pollination: Breeders select two parent plants with complementary traits and manually transfer pollen from the male reproductive organ (stamen) of one plant to the female reproductive organ (pistil) of another. This process is called cross-pollination and is usually done by hand to ensure controlled breeding. 3.

{"text": "Humans selectively breed plants through a process called artificial selection, which involves choosing specific plants with desirable traits to reproduce. The goal is to enhance or combine these traits in the offspring, resulting in improved or novel varieties over time. Here is an overview of the steps involved in selective breeding of plants: 1. Trait Identification: First, breeders identify the traits they wish to enhance or combine. These traits could include disease resistance, drought tolerance, increased yield, enhanced nutritional content, improved flavor, or specific physical characteristics like size, color, and shape. 2. Parent Selection: Breeders select parent plants that exhibit the desired traits. These plants are known as the P (parental) generation. 3.

{"text": "When you are anxious, your brain will automatically increase respiration rate. This is done to physically prepare your body to either run or fight. When you increase the number of breaths you take in a given amount of time, your heart rate increases as well. Your higher heart rate causes things like tingling in the extremities (blood vessels narrow and pull blood towards the vitals, leaving less blood in hands/feet). Vision narrows, hearing becomes attuned to specific stimuli. Hypervigilance sets in. Adrenaline has been pumping through your body. - - Lowering your heart rate is key to controlling anxiety. Manually breathing in through your mouth and out through your nose assists in two ways: 1) it requires a change of thought process. Breathing in this way is not natural. You need to concentrate to make every breath. This change of thought process pulls our mind away from the catastrophic anxiety cycle/circle.  2) the long deep breaths assist in slowing your heart rate. The same way fast, short and shallow breaths will increase the heart rate, these long, so and slow breaths will assist in slowing the heart. TL;DR- slowing your heart rate and changing your thought process can help alleviate anxiety, anger and stress. One way to do both, is by breathing slow and deep in through your nose and out through your mouth.", "label": "human", "label_int": 0, "est_prob_list": [[4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 3.9120230674743652], [4.277135171806114, 4.605170185988091, 4.192950380985522, 4.605170185988091, 4.5275185506534426, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.0491959026881625, 4.605170185988091], [0.4620353579521179, 2.9215174246301476, 0.17726195852987708, 4.605170185988091, 0.9502457976778063, 4.605170185988091, 2.8514932346221595, 3.7768680254618325, 3.948724546602794, 3.4107962339749385], [3.2188756465911865, 0.8444948577172389, 0.3347628121288809, 4.605170185988091, 0.9959817581476625, 4.605170185988091, 2.813410758972168, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 2.076017102802534], [0.8836601523423631, 0.7550225257873535, 0.15183932596018193, 4.605170185988091, 0.5018024551016944, 4.605170185988091, 2.3394594205283523, 3.64171294371287, 3.0056210926600864, 2.2715965361601844], [2.048669883013082, 0.4700036292457356, 4.605170185988091, 0.1246424452072766, 3.4657359027997265, 4.446565155811453, 0.44531101665536404, 4.605170185988091, 1.8562979903656263, 4.605170185988091], [2.2129729343043585, 1.807507826196194, 3.242592351485517, 0.179201429457711, 3.7534179752515073, 1.114360645636249, 0.6473376445286511, 4.605170185988091, 1.5939337258981352, 4.605170185988091]], "target_roberta_idx": [130, 170, 198, 201, 228, 237, 239, 240, 244, 263], "target_prob_idx": [115, 154, 179, 182, 209, 217, 219, 220, 224, 243]}

{"text": "Breathing is the most basic of all human functions. It's a way to keep your body alive, it helps you think clearly, and it can even make you feel better. When we breathe deeply, oxygen enters into our bloodstream and stimulates nerve endings that send messages throughout our bodies telling us how relaxed or stressed we are feeling at any given moment. The more often we practice deep breaths, the easier they become for us. If you're having trouble sleeping because you have anxiety, try taking some slow, deep breaths before bedtime. If you wake up during the night due to an upset stomach, take a few long, calming breaths as soon as you realize what's happening. You'll find yourself calmer and less anxious when you get back to sleep.

{"text": "Manually breathing in through the nose and out through the mouth can help with stress, anxiety, and nausea for several reasons: 1. Nasal breathing: When we breathe in through our noses, the olfactory receptors in the nasal cavity detect the scent molecules in the air and send signals to the brain, which can have a calming effect on the nervous system. This can help to reduce stress and anxiety. 2. Oxygenation: Nose breathing allows for more efficient oxygenation of the body, as the nasal passages are designed to warm, humidify, and filter the air before it reaches the lungs. This can help to increase oxygen levels in the body, which can help to reduce feelings of fatigue and improve overall well-being. 3. Relaxation response: The act of consciously controlling our breath can trigger the relaxation response, which can help to counteract the effects of stress and anxiety. By focusing on our breath, we can distract ourselves from worrisome thoughts and emotions and enter a state of calm and relaxation. 4. Baroreceptor reflex: Breathing in through the nose and out through the mouth can also activate the baroreceptor reflex, which helps to regulate blood pressure and heart rate.

{"text": "Manually breathing in through the nose and out through the mouth can help with stress, anxiety, and nausea due to its impact on the body's stress response system. When we experience stress or anxiety, our body's sympathetic nervous system is activated, leading to an increase in heart rate, blood pressure, and shallow breathing. This response is commonly known as the \"fight-or-flight\" response. By consciously taking slow, deep breaths through the nose and exhaling through the mouth, we can activate the body's parasympathetic nervous system, which is responsible for the relaxation response. This helps counteract the effects of the stress response and induces a state of calmness. Breathing through the nose has several benefits. Firstly, the nasal passages are lined with tiny hairs called cilia, which filter and humidify the air we breathe. This ensures that the air reaching the lungs is clean and properly conditioned. Nasal breathing also activates the diaphragm, the main muscle responsible for breathing, allowing for more efficient and deeper breaths. It also stimulates the vagus nerve, which helps regulate heart rate and digestion, promoting relaxation. Exhaling through the mouth helps release tension and stress from the body. It allows for a longer exhale, which activates the body's relaxation response even further.", "label": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "label_int": 6, "est_prob_list": [[4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 3.5065577030181885, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091], [4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 3.5065579414367676, 3.5065579414367676, 3.5065579414367676, 2.525728702545166, 2.5832651138305662, 4.605170185988091, 3.9120230674743652], [4.605170185988091, 0.07274169940501451, 0.08338159322738647, 1.6025644136326653, 2.995732069015503, 2.995732069015503, 0.0, 4.0, 0.011544392577239446, 1.2039728164672852], [4.605170185988091, 0.20363838551566005, 0.26136478781700134, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 0.010050326585769653, 4.006030195951462, 0.5838006564549038, 3.9120230674743652], [4.605170185988091, 0.04640650749206543, 0.061875343322753906, 2.8857168470110213, 3.5065579414367676, 3.5065579414367676, 0.0, 4.0, 0.35210633277893066, 1.56064772605896], [0.1356217106138301, 0.04289073477919412, 0.06325320353044253, 2.4096832285504126, 0.05909328698855588, 1.7165360479904674, 0.0005512742999773381, 0.21904786313616073, 0.007640854189848181, 0.7899282032089493], [0.179201429457711, 0.3194307707663612, 2.906120114864304, 1.7165360479904674, 0.1158318155251217, 1.9075912847531766, 0.08985632912186105, 0.2173012756899814, 2.367123614131617, 1.9616585060234524]], "target_roberta_idx": [26, 42, 42, 50, 51, 52, 95, 96, 142, 220], "target_prob_idx": [24, 40, 41, 48, 49, 50, 88, 89, 130, 201]}
{"text": "Manually breathing in through the nose and out through the mouth can help with stress, anxiety, and nausea due to several physiological and psychological factors: 1. **Parasympathetic Activation**: Deep, controlled breathing activates the body's parasympathetic nervous system, which is responsible for the 'rest and digest' state. This contrasts with the sympathetic nervous system, which governs the 'fight or flight' response often triggered by stress or anxiety. Activating the parasympathetic nervous system helps to calm the body, reducing stress and anxiety levels. 2. **Increased Oxygen, Decreased Carbon Dioxide**: Slow, deep breaths increase oxygen intake and allow for more efficient expulsion of carbon dioxide. This can alleviate the rapid, shallow breathing associated with anxiety (hyperventilation), which can lead to a decrease in blood carbon dioxide levels and subsequent symptoms like dizziness, tingling, and nausea. 3. **Mindfulness and Focus**: Focusing on the act of breathing can serve as a form of mindfulness, which may distract from stressors or anxious thoughts, grounding an individual in the present moment. This focus can also reduce the perception of nausea. 4. **Diaphragmatic Breathing**: Breathing in through the nose encourages diaphragmatic breathing, which is deeper and more efficient.", "label": "gpt-4-1106-preview", "label_int": 7, "est_prob_list": [[4.605170185988091, 4.115712940692902, 3.912022829055786, 3.912022829055786, 3.912022829055786, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091], [3.2644728251865933, 4.279737424850464, 3.912022829055786, 3.912022829055786, 3.912022829055786, 2.995732307434082, 1.8952749520540237, 2.722178667783737, 4.605170185988091, 2.5855238914489744], [4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 1.0216511487960815, 1.5709572732448578, 4.605170185988091, 0.0, 1.1512925624847412, 0.0, 0.006734229003389676, 0.37136231660842894], [4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 2.813410758972168, 0.04573946197827657, 0.9780057072639465, 0.0, 0.07172514622410138, 0.48283138275146487], [4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 1.469675898551941, 1.7336890995502472, 4.605170185988091, 0.0016750544309616089, 0.3094685971736908, 0.0, 0.06547698223342498, 0.12014325857162475], [0.9500575943449725, 1.6331544390514163, 0.16989903679539747, 4.446565155811453, 0.36902771190573336, 0.07290677080808779, 3.4657359027997265, 1.8316053777752546, 4.605170185988091, 3.912023005428146], [1.556193397915288, 1.9616585060234524, 0.11259820634935909, 4.605170185988091, 0.3493919541008597, 0.0006744880103756145, 0.27889365719910564, 2.5494451709255714, 0.006083818811233888, 4.605170185988091]], "target_roberta_idx": [28, 37, 46, 47, 47, 74, 137, 145, 168, 233], "target_prob_idx": [26, 33, 42, 43, 44, 66, 123, 131, 153, 214]}

{"text": "Because they are. A: I think it's because of a combination of factors, but I'll try and list them in order of importance (in my opinion): 1) The south is generally more rural than other parts of America. This means that there aren't as many opportunities for education or employment outside of farming/fishing/hunting. Also, most southern states have large populations of poor whites who don't speak English very well.

This stereotype is also reinforced by the fact that many Southerners tend to be more conservative and less educated than people in other parts of the country.

{"text": "It is important to recognize that generalizations about people from the Deep South being simpletons are unfair and inaccurate. Such stereotypes are rooted in historical biases and cultural misunderstandings. It is crucial to avoid perpetuating these stereotypes and instead appreciate the diversity and complexity of individuals within any region. One reason why some people may have misconceptions about people from the Deep South is the historical portrayal of the region in popular culture. Media often depicts the Deep South as a place with a slower pace of life, rural landscapes, and a distinct accent. These portrayals have contributed to the creation of stereotypes that label people from the Deep South as simple or unintelligent.

{"text": "The stereotype of people from the Deep South in the United States as \"simpletons\" is an unfortunate and inaccurate generalization that likely stems from a complex mix of historical, cultural, and socio-economic factors. Here are a few contributing elements: 1. Educational Disparities: Historically, some areas of the Deep South have faced challenges related to education, including lower levels of educational attainment and fewer resources for schools. This can lead to perceptions of lower intelligence or simplicity, even though education level is not an accurate measure of a person's intellect or capabilities. 2. Rural Character: The Deep South is characterized by its rural landscapes and agricultural economy. Rural areas, in general, have been stereotypically associated with a slower pace of life and a focus on practical, hands-on skills rather than intellectual pursuits. This stereotype can be misconstrued to suggest that rural inhabitants are less sophisticated or worldly. 3.", "label": "gpt-4-1106-preview", "label_int": 7, "est_prob_list": [[4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 3.813001905168806, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.349327458275689, 4.605170185988091], [4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 3.763346254825592, 3.5322115818659463, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 2.9703553915023804], [0.2744368612766266, 2.2631036885082723, 2.857142857142857, 4.605170185988091, 0.2744368612766266, 0.41551539301872253, 3.2188756465911865, 2.995732307434082, 2.246221595340305, 1.3795182364327567], [2.3025851249694824, 3.857636296749115, 2.857142857142857, 4.585885352144639, 0.7985077500343323, 3.2188758850097656, 4.605170185988091, 3.9120230674743652, 2.2669999400774636, 0.9012832684176308], [1.1394342184066772, 3.700812518596649, 2.857142857142857, 4.605170185988091, 0.9416085481643677, 0.2744368612766266, 3.9120230674743652, 0.24846139550209045, 0.7037966284486983, 1.0911133289337158], [2.7119641004233466, 1.9616585060234524, 3.147282171681192, 3.5992672954242493, 1.5378442592470916, 0.01972450534777859, 1.3862943611198906, 0.17453941635189968, 4.605170185988091, 2.018816919863401], [2.018816919863401, 1.6739764335716716, 1.4683701963067024, 1.2966822024302034, 1.5198257537444133, 0.0841005247618926, 1.6331544390514163, 0.08985632912186105, 4.605170185988091, 1.5939337258981352]], "target_roberta_idx": [31, 66, 68, 74, 110, 144, 147, 150, 151, 170], "target_prob_idx": [28, 59, 61, 67, 103, 136, 139, 142, 143, 158]}
{"text": "When corporation wants to raise money from the financial markets they contact an investment bank to issue a security (e.g. a stock or a bond). For example, if ACME corp wants to raise $1B of capital through a bond offering they will call up an investment bank or a group of investment banks (called a syndicate) and hire them to \"underwrite that security\". Here's what the transaction looks like.  1. ACME gets their $1B of cash up front directly from their Investment Bank 2. The Investment Bank Receives the securities, in this case, bond certificates from ACME corporation agreeing to pay back the $1B over a set period of time with pre-determined interest payments (coupons) 3. The bank uses its sales and trading network to re-sell the bonds to its network of institutional investors. They typically do this at a slight mark-up, but the bank also assumes the risk of the bonds not selling well and they will occasionally (read: very rarely, but still a very real possibility) lose money on the deal.  4. The bank also typically agrees to support the price of the debt offering in the secondary market by providing liquidity for investors up to a certain point.

{"text": "It means that the bank is lending money to another party, but they are not guaranteeing that the loan will be repaid. In other words, if you borrow $100 from your friend's bank, you do not have any guarantee that he or she will pay you back with interest. The bank can simply take your money at any time without any consequences. This is why banks lend money to people who cannot afford to repay it. It is also why banks make loans to businesses that may never pay them back. Banks are essentially gambling on the future of their customers' money. The reason for this is because banks are required by law to hold reserves against their deposits. If there was no reserve requirement, then banks would just keep depositing more money into their accounts until they ran out of money. However, since they must maintain reserves, they need to lend money to people who cannot afford to repay it. So, when a person makes a deposit at his/her bank, the bank lends him/her some money (the \"borrowed funds\"). The bank then guarantees that the borrower will pay the borrowed funds back with interest. The bank does this by purchasing securities issued by the borrower's business.

They also have to make sure that there's enough collateral backing up whatever debt you're taking out so that if things go bad for them, they'll still get paid back.", "label": "gpt-j-6b", "label_int": 2, "est_prob_list": [[3.404164969921112, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 3.9120230674743652, 3.9120230674743652, 3.019639864563942, 3.9120230674743652, 3.5065579414367676, 4.605170185988091], [4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 3.5065579414367676, 2.959267997741699, 2.995732307434082, 2.995732307434082, 3.030432917177677, 4.605170185988091, 2.995732069015503, 3.107304096221924], [2.351312612493833, 2.787272911010818, 0.6539264917373657, 4.605170185988091, 3.9120229482650757, 3.912022829055786, 0.7765287756919861, 3.2511450052261353, 1.338779006153345, 0.8731637746095657], [3.0578485230604806, 2.7893104295838964, 1.3862943649291992, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 3.9120230674743652, 0.31471070647239685, 3.1073039770126343, 3.1392624229192734, 0.7787068537436426], [2.9508819530407586, 2.8114451647482137, 0.7765287160873413, 4.605170185988091, 2.7018388509750366, 2.995732307434082, 0.5447272062301636, 2.5179766416549683, 1.8436649441719055, 1.1933972537517548], [4.605170185988091, 0.13800567301944372, 4.605170185988091, 0.9007865453381898, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 0.11145544092532282, 2.3263016196113617, 4.605170185988091, 2.4096832285504126], [4.605170185988091, 0.26706278524904525, 4.605170185988091, 0.38612214526503347, 4.605170185988091, 3.4657359027997265, 0.9602099658089905, 2.1439800628174073, 4.605170185988091, 1.2685113254635072]], "target_roberta_idx": [23, 33, 44, 55, 77, 77, 94, 101, 115, 122], "target_prob_idx": [22, 29, 40, 51, 73, 74, 90, 97, 111, 118]}

The underwriting process typically involves a series of steps, including: 1. Credit analysis: The lender reviews the borrower's credit history and financial statements to determine their creditworthiness. 2. Risk assessment: The lender assesses the risk of default by the borrower and determines the appropriate interest rate and other terms for the loan. 3. Loan approval: The lender makes a decision on whether to approve the loan based on the results of the underwriting process. The purpose of underwriting is to ensure that the lender is not exposed to excessive risk when making a loan. By carefully evaluating the creditworthiness of the borrower, the lender can minimize the risk of default and maximize the likelihood of repayment.

{"text": "In the context of banking and finance, \"underwriting a security\" refers to the process by which a financial institution or an individual investor assumes the risk of a security's issuance. This means that the underwriter guarantees the security's value, ensuring that the issuer will receive a certain amount of money from the sale of the security, regardless of whether the security is ultimately sold to investors or not. When an underwriter takes on the risk of an issuance, they typically do so in exchange for a fee, which is typically a percentage of the total value of the issuance. The underwriter's role is to evaluate the creditworthiness of the issuer and the market demand for the security, and to determine the appropriate price for the security based on these factors. Underwriting is a critical component of the capital markets, as it provides a mechanism for issuers to raise capital and for investors to purchase securities. Without underwriting, it would be difficult for companies and governments to raise the necessary funds to finance their operations and investments.

{"text": "Underwriting a security in the context of banking and finance refers to the process of assessing the risk associated with issuing or selling a security, such as stocks or bonds, and guaranteeing its sale to investors. It involves evaluating the financial condition and creditworthiness of the issuer, determining the appropriate pricing and terms of the security, and marketing it to potential buyers. When a company or government entity plans to issue securities to raise capital, it may seek the assistance of an underwriter, usually an investment bank. The underwriter acts as an intermediary between the issuer and the investors, assuming the responsibility of ensuring a successful sale of the securities. During the underwriting process, the underwriter conducts extensive due diligence on the issuer, analyzing its financial statements, business operations, and market conditions.

{"text": "In banking and finance, \"underwriting a security\" refers to the process by which an investment bank or a syndicate of banks evaluates and assumes the risk of issuing new securities on behalf of a corporation or government entity. The underwriter performs a critical role in new security issuances, such as stocks or bonds, by guaranteeing the sale of the securities to investors. Here's how the underwriting process typically works: 1. **Assessment of Risk**: The underwriter starts by conducting due diligence to assess the financial health and prospects of the issuer, which includes scrutinizing their financial statements, management team, market conditions, and any other factors that might affect the success of the issuance. 2. **Pricing**: Based on this assessment, the underwriter helps to determine the appropriate price for the securities. Pricing is influenced by market conditions, the issuer's financial situation, and the perceived risk associated with the securities. 3. **Guarantee of Sale**: The underwriter agrees to buy the entire issue of securities from the issuer and then resells them to investors. By doing this, the underwriter guarantees the issuer that they will raise the intended funds and thus removes the risk that the issuer will not be able to sell the securities. 4.", "label": "gpt-4-1106-preview", "label_int": 7, "est_prob_list": [[4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091], [3.2188756465911865, 3.2188756465911865, 3.2188756465911865, 3.5065577030181885, 3.5065577030181885, 4.605170185988091, 0.7133498787879944, 3.9120230674743652, 4.605170185988091, 3.912022829055786], [0.030459178611636162, 0.06238491367548704, 0.09431064873933792, 0.036285340785980225, 0.22181718051433563, 0.051293306052684784, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 0.010050326585769653], [0.07257068157196045, 0.4467756152153015, 0.8209805488586426, 0.08125945180654526, 0.3044029697775841, 0.10536054521799088, 1.4135090510050456, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 0.6733445525169373], [0.0, 0.15055254101753235, 0.3011050820350647, 0.20775769650936127, 0.7620889991521835, 0.5276327729225159, 2.3377052942911782, 4.605170185988091, 3.9120230674743652, 0.18632952868938446], [0.33569129163814154, 1.2547180033311713, 1.6950298427695039, 0.179201429457711, 4.1588830833596715, 0.4392319705789819, 0.38612214526503347, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 0.5893503868783018], [0.0027687435924662897, 0.03093657613536295, 0.6623755218931916, 0.06453852113757118, 0.3404412587392132, 0.016606777357045424, 0.11839382979992889, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 0.02154782276699116]], "target_roberta_idx": [30, 31, 32, 59, 60, 64, 103, 141, 149, 240], "target_prob_idx": [27, 28, 29, 54, 55, 59, 97, 136, 142, 228]}

Criminal cases can be time-consuming and resource-intensive, and plea bargaining allows the court to focus on more serious cases that are less likely to be resolved through a plea bargain.

{"text": "Plea bargaining is a process in criminal cases where the defendant agrees to plead guilty to a lesser charge, or to only some of the charges, in exchange for a more lenient sentence or other considerations. This agreement is negotiated between the defendant (usually represented by their attorney) and the prosecutor. There are several reasons why plea bargaining is allowed and widely used in the justice system: 1. Efficiency: Courts are often overloaded with cases, and trials can be lengthy and expensive. Plea bargains can significantly reduce the number of cases that go to trial, saving time and resources for the court system, the prosecution, and the defense. 2. Certainty of Outcome: Trials are inherently uncertain.", "label": "gpt-4-1106-preview", "label_int": 7, "est_prob_list": [[4.411671381443739, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 3.3467345767550998, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 3.883381336927414, 3.9120230674743652, 3.9120230674743652, 4.605170185988091], [3.461358718574047, 2.6643580913543703, 3.2188758850097656, 4.605170185988091, 1.3862943649291992, 1.3862943649291992, 3.8994858066240945, 3.5065579414367676, 3.5065579414367676, 3.680974006652832], [0.3876126129180193, 0.1609144514426589, 0.0, 0.16778279675377739, 0.37664341926574707, 0.0, 0.0340183482815822, 0.0, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091], [0.39372891560196877, 0.13589950054883956, 0.3710636794567108, 0.09931036167674595, 4.0, 0.0, 0.11941883557786544, 0.0, 4.605170185988091, 3.9120230674743652], [0.42571986373513937, 0.1661661161109805, 0.040822017937898636, 0.08699437520570225, 0.7330325603485107, 0.0, 0.32138538857301074, 0.0, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091], [0.4093790074293007, 3.912023005428146, 0.42121346507630353, 1.3862943611198906, 4.605170185988091, 0.29815337231907635, 2.906120114864304, 0.7248958788745256, 1.3555227024531369, 0.5684437020589881], [0.48258241145259567, 4.605170185988091, 0.6325225587435105, 0.7088955375280844, 4.1588830833596715, 1.0453677741492975, 0.03678735171947956, 1.3862943611198906, 1.1281616643736463, 0.132726828817913]], "target_roberta_idx": [32, 46, 47, 49, 61, 62, 71, 83, 84, 120], "target_prob_idx": [29, 42, 43, 45, 57, 58, 67, 79, 80, 114]}
{"text": "With the prevalence of sports nowadays, whether taking part in sports as a team or an individual is more beneficial has sparked off a lively debate. While many believe that playing sports as teams can elevate one's teamwork skills, others believe that playing sports alone can develop self-determination and confidence. Given that sports can be played in either conditions, I would like to discuss both perspectives before giving my opinion. When it comes to sports, most people would think of team sports such as football, basketball and volleyball. These kinds of sports can help us to evolve important life skills. Especially for children, playing team sports is an indispensible method to develop interpersonal skills. Working as a teammate helps one to build relations and communicate with one another, distributing responsibilities. As a result, the skills the children learnt will be used to cope with future life as teenagers and adults. Although playing sports alone will not gain any benefits from what I have mentioned above, it will help us to establish skills for an individual, such as self-determination and confidence, as well as concentrate for a long period. For instance, individual sports such as swimming and karate, require sportspeople to build their bravery, as well as formulate techniques to face their opponents. Therefore, even though working in teams can develop better abilities, we should not overlook the fact that doing sports as one can also volatilize its advantage. Having discussed how sports played alone and as a group can develop corresponding skills, from my perspective, I reckon that playing sports in teams is more beneficial. Almost all walks of life require communication with others, so skills developed in teams are more advantageous then those in person.", "label": "human", "label_int": 0, "est_prob_list": [[4.605170185988091, 4.374121189117432, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091], [4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 3.5065579414367676, 4.293322131833546, 3.2188756465911865, 3.2188756465911865, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 3.9120230674743652, 3.9120230674743652], [1.2067482904981304, 4.605170185988091, 1.3470736742019653, 1.3470736742019653, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.319672114172319, 3.5719981655127166, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091], [2.8512940448232102, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 2.393525619498027, 2.5631553946276546, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091], [1.0803164939085643, 4.605170185988091, 1.56064772605896, 2.2751602503775623, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 3.8184303563851447, 2.4975090506889464, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091], [3.4657359027997265, 0.5017523275603158, 2.8371272433773522, 2.1439800628174073, 4.605170185988091, 0.19331931100349597, 3.242592351485517, 2.111190239994416, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091], [3.242592351485517, 0.5893503868783018, 4.605170185988091, 2.2129729343043585, 4.605170185988091, 0.4575811092471784, 2.906120114864304, 1.9616585060234524, 4.1588830833596715, 4.605170185988091]], "target_roberta_idx": [60, 92, 121, 122, 167, 168, 204, 248, 327, 328], "target_prob_idx": [57, 89, 118, 119, 163, 164, 198, 240, 316, 317]}

{"text": "The first thing I noticed was how many different opinions there were on this issue. Some people thought team games were a good idea because they could help you learn teamwork skills; while others said that playing individually would be much easier as you wouldn't have anyone else around to distract you. However, most of them agreed that if you wanted to play an individual sport then you should choose something where you can do well without relying on other players. This way you will not get discouraged when things don't go according to plan. For example, some people might say that tennis isn't really an individual game but rather one where you need to work with someone else. If you want to improve at basketball, you won't just practice by yourself - you'll also need teammates who can pass the ball to each other so that you can shoot baskets together. In addition, some people believe that team games are important because they allow you to develop social skills such as being able to communicate effectively with your friends. These kinds of skills are very useful later in life, especially since we spend so much time working alongside our colleagues and co-workers. So although I agree that team games aren't always easy, I still think they're worth doing. After all, what's the point of learning anything unless you use it? My view is similar to those who argue that team games are best because they teach us cooperation and communication skills.

{"text": "In my opinion, both team and individual sports have their own unique benefits, and it is difficult to say definitively which one is more beneficial. However, I will present some arguments for both views and provide my own perspective. On the one hand, team sports like football, basketball, and soccer offer numerous benefits for those who participate. Firstly, team sports promote social interaction and teamwork, which are essential skills in any profession or aspect of life. Players must work together towards a common goal, communicate effectively, and support each other to achieve success. This fosters a sense of camaraderie and unity, which can be difficult to replicate in individual sports. Additionally, team sports provide an opportunity for physical exercise, strategy, and problem-solving, which can help to improve cognitive function and overall physical health. On the other hand, individual sports like swimming, tennis, and running offer unique benefits that are not found in team sports. For instance, individual sports allow athletes to focus solely on their own performance and improvement, without the distraction of relying on others. This can be particularly beneficial for those who are self-motivated and disciplined, as they can set their own goals and work towards achieving them without the pressure of team dynamics. Additionally, individual sports often require a high level of mental toughness and discipline, which can help to build resilience and character.

{"text": "In recent years, there has been a growing debate about whether team sports or individual sports are more beneficial for individuals. While some people believe that team sports are the way to go, others argue that individual sports have their own advantages. In this essay, I will discuss both perspectives and provide my own opinion on the matter. On the one hand, team sports have many benefits. Firstly, they promote teamwork and cooperation. When playing a team sport, individuals learn to work together towards a common goal. This can help to improve communication skills, leadership skills, and problem-solving abilities. Additionally, team sports provide an opportunity for individuals to learn how to handle both victory and defeat graciously, as the outcome of the game depends on the performance of the entire team. On the other hand, individual sports also have their own benefits. For example, individual sports like swimming or running allow individuals to focus on their own performance and improvement. This can help to build self-confidence and self-esteem, as individuals can set their own goals and work towards achieving them. Additionally, individual sports can provide a sense of independence and freedom, as individuals do not have to rely on others to succeed. In my opinion, both team and individual sports have their own unique benefits, and it ultimately depends on personal preferences and goals. For example, if an individual values teamwork and cooperation, then team sports may be a better choice. On the other hand, if an individual values self-improvement and independence, then individual sports may be a better option.

In my opinion, both types of sports have their own advantages, and the choice depends on an individual's preferences and goals. On one hand, team sports have several benefits.

In team sports like football, players learn to communicate effectively, trust their teammates, and work together to achieve a common goal. This not only enhances their interpersonal skills but also teaches them important life lessons such as leadership, cooperation, and conflict resolution. Secondly, team sports provide a sense of belonging and camaraderie. Being part of a team fosters a sense of unity and motivates individuals to strive for success collectively. Lastly, team sports often involve strategic planning and decision-making, as players need to coordinate their movements and make split-second choices. This helps in developing critical thinking skills and the ability to analyze situations under pressure. On the other hand, individual sports offer unique advantages as well. Firstly, they promote self-discipline and self-motivation. In individual sports like swimming, athletes are solely responsible for their performance and improvement. They learn to set goals, manage their time effectively, and stay motivated even when faced with challenges. This self-reliance translates into other aspects of life, enabling individuals to take charge of their own success.

{"text": "Participation in sports, whether team-based or individual, offers numerous benefits including physical health, mental well-being, and social skills development. There is debate, however, regarding whether team sports like football or individual sports like swimming are more advantageous. This essay will discuss both perspectives before expressing a personal viewpoint. Advocates of team sports argue that such activities encourage the development of essential social skills. Playing sports like football requires communication, cooperation, and understanding between team members, fostering a sense of community and teamwork. These sports also teach individuals about leadership and how to work harmoniously towards a common goal. Moreover, team sports can be motivational, as the group dynamic encourages players to train and perform to the best of their abilities, not wanting to let their teammates down. Real-world examples of this include the camaraderie and collective spirit seen in successful football teams, which can often be the driving force behind their triumphs. Conversely, proponents of individual sports posit that activities like swimming offer unique benefits. Individual sports can cultivate self-reliance and personal responsibility, as the athlete's success or failure rests solely on their own efforts. This can lead to a deeper sense of personal achievement and confidence. Furthermore, individual sports can be more flexible in terms of practice schedules, allowing athletes to train at their own pace and on their own time.

Additionally, AI systems can perform tasks that are too complex or repetitive for humans to handle efficiently.", "label": "vicuna-13b-v1.5", "label_int": 4, "est_prob_list": [[4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 3.423361214724454, 3.406877136230469, 4.605170185988091], [4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 3.912022829055786, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 3.198667655388514, 2.9891615455800835, 3.0598394870758057, 2.525728702545166], [0.4693462583753798, 0.05113335251808167, 0.051293306052684784, 0.9162907004356384, 0.9162907004356384, 0.4581453502178192, 0.0351201593875885, 0.13465886359865015, 0.17851482629776, 1.9661128520965576], [2.9439837402767606, 0.2898588180541992, 0.3856624662876129, 2.6592600345611572, 2.6592600345611572, 1.382310289889574, 0.25166286279757816, 2.35563980855725, 3.129618453979492, 1.4271162748336792], [0.4047200272659576, 0.13191447854042054, 0.4004775285720825, 0.5108255743980408, 0.4419349314586965, 0.22257126974770364, 0.33279408017794293, 0.09951238131179069, 0.4782695770263672, 1.309333324432373], [4.1588830833596715, 0.7088955375280844, 1.5378442592470916, 0.29815337231907635, 0.9400072584914712, 2.6548056865833978, 1.1884686177899708, 0.4889316391312544, 0.3522205935893521, 0.5684437020589881], [4.1588830833596715, 1.0018826622095587, 2.1439800628174073, 0.3087354816496133, 0.9400072584914712, 4.605170185988091, 0.7576857016975165, 2.5494451709255714, 0.8266785731844679, 0.5082248420659333]], "target_roberta_idx": [38, 55, 60, 61, 62, 64, 86, 91, 92, 104], "target_prob_idx": [34, 48, 53, 54, 55, 57, 78, 83, 84, 96]}

Overall, these changes occur because of women are entering the work force, which changes the roles of a traditional family. I strongly believe that these changes are positive to society and to the economy. In the following paragraphs I will present my reasons to have such opinion. One major factor that affects family structures is women being allowed to work outside their homes. Within the last century, women joined the work force, modifying the traditional family setting that was compoused by men being the ones who provided for their families. Therefore, the roles changed as both mothers and fathers could financially provide for their children. Moreover, women do not need to rely on their husbands to raise children as they have jobs themselves, and they might even decide to raise a baby by their own, creating a new type of family strucutre that is comprised of only a mother and a child. Furthermore, couples can even decide not to have children at all, and only focus on their carreers, as women have the possibility of being a lot more than mothers. These changes are definitly positive of an economical and societal point of view. Women are now part of the work force, therefore, they contribute for the economy. Besides that, changes in family structures and roles make people more tolerant, as they see that there is no limitation for what a women can do. To summarize, there are indeed several changes occurring in families structures, and the roles people play in it. Women being part of the work force has changed male and female contribution to a family, which has a positive impact, socially and economically speaking.", "label": "human", "label_int": 0, "est_prob_list": [[4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 3.912022829055786, 3.912022829055786, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091], [4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 3.045888060167371, 2.525728464126587], [1.2724587876332927, 2.0402207374572754, 1.649314026037852, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.525698932564078, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091], [2.0402207374572754, 4.605170185988091, 4.052573754514518, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091], [1.1711829900741577, 3.7396749717819104, 2.9134247774290443, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091], [4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 0.31406882762497584, 0.2929040164329326, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 0.9913005528790216, 4.446565155811453, 2.2129729343043585], [4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 3.4657359027997265, 0.6473376445286511, 0.2173012756899814, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 0.7744928200138977, 3.7534179752515073, 1.1384581972153094]], "target_roberta_idx": [22, 25, 26, 77, 110, 147, 165, 166, 279, 280], "target_prob_idx": [21, 24, 25, 76, 108, 145, 163, 164, 271, 272]}
{"text": "The following is an example of a question that I have been asked many times in my classes. It is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all possible questions, but rather a starting point for discussion. \"What do you think about the fact that the average age at which children become parents has increased over time?\" My response: This is a very interesting question. The average age of first marriage has decreased by more than half since 1960. This means that there are now fewer people who will marry before they reach their mid-20s. In addition, the number of women who get married after having had one child has also declined significantly. These trends indicate that we are living longer and that our society is changing. However, it is important to note that this change does not necessarily mean that we are becoming less religious. There are still many young adults who choose to remain unmarried. Many of them may be attracted to the idea of being single and free to pursue their passions without the pressure of a partner. Others may simply want to enjoy life alone. Regardless of why someone chooses to remain single, it is important to remember that it is a choice. If you feel that you would like to start a family, then you should make that decision based on what makes you happy. As far as the increase in the age at which people become parents goes, I believe that this trend is due to several factors. First, the rise in education levels has allowed more people to enter into the workforce. Second, the availability of birth control has made it easier for couples to plan pregnancies.", "label": "gpt2-xl", "label_int": 1, "est_prob_list": [[4.258596658706665, 3.0165104601118298, 3.912022829055786, 2.813410758972168, 4.605170185988091, 3.2188758850097656, 3.2188758850097656, 2.995732307434082, 4.605170185988091, 3.3573974628340113], [2.9801830649375916, 3.5817990832858615, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 2.813410758972168, 3.9120230674743652, 3.9120230674743652, 3.813002041407994, 2.153184712271799], [0.0833815261721611, 2.330014016893175, 0.0, 1.8904973566532135, 1.2729655504226685, 0.0, 1.3081927746534348, 0.7550225853919983, 2.4079456329345703, 1.2856442494825884], [0.061875343322753906, 3.5817990832858615, 0.0, 4.605170185988091, 2.1202635765075684, 0.0, 2.17793732881546, 1.6094379425048828, 4.605170185988091, 2.4692374142733486], [0.46203547716140747, 1.0782289505004883, 0.0, 1.93161641061306, 1.6094378232955933, 0.02020268701016903, 1.1087708324193954, 1.1711828708648682, 2.1202635765075684, 2.1250012408603323], [4.605170185988091, 1.4847344339331432, 1.807507826196194, 0.4889316391312544, 0.16068238169047347, 0.20284319251475147, 1.1263368366829645, 3.9357395320454622, 2.2129729343043585, 4.605170185988091], [4.605170185988091, 1.2966822024302034, 0.9808292530117262, 0.5212969236332861, 0.7411563997463059, 1.2411123512753928, 1.4180430594344708, 4.1588830833596715, 1.8562979903656263, 4.605170185988091]], "target_roberta_idx": [23, 60, 61, 77, 80, 137, 157, 208, 311, 314], "target_prob_idx": [22, 59, 60, 77, 80, 134, 154, 205, 308, 311]}
{"text": "The family is a very important part of our society. It provides us with security, love, support and guidance in life. However, it also brings many problems to people's lives. The most common problem that families face nowadays is divorce. Divorce can be defined as \"the legal dissolution of marriage\". This means when two married couples decide to separate they go through different processes which may lead them to file for divorce. In some cases this process takes place without anyone even knowing about it. For example, if one partner wants out but does not want to tell their spouse then there will be no official record of the separation. On the other hand, if both parties agree on getting divorced then they have to follow certain procedures before filing for divorce. These procedures involve going to court where the judge decides whether or not the couple should get divorced. If the judge agrees with the decision made by the couple then he/she issues an order stating what must happen next. After all this happens the couple files for divorce. There are several advantages and disadvantages to having a divorce. Some of the benefits of divorcing are; firstly, it gives each person freedom because they do not need to live together anymore. Secondly, it allows each party to start over again and find someone new who loves them more than ever. Thirdly, it helps children understand why parents split up. Lastly, it makes things easier for everyone involved. One disadvantage of divorces is that it causes stress and tension between partners. Another disadvantage is that it affects the whole community.", "label": "gpt-j-6b", "label_int": 2, "est_prob_list": [[4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.327911376953125, 4.605170185988091, 3.9120229721069335, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091], [3.5065579414367676, 4.605170185988091, 2.0402209758758545, 4.246818351745605, 3.5065579414367676, 2.5257285594940186, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 2.453902761141459, 4.605170185988091], [1.6607311964035034, 2.3025851249694824, 1.7147983312606812, 1.6094379425048828, 0.6931471824645996, 3.7498370170593263, 2.0117974281311035, 0.7412865191698075, 0.19896097481250763, 2.4079456329345703], [4.605170185988091, 3.912022829055786, 1.7719568014144897, 4.605170185988091, 0.28768208622932434, 4.605170185988091, 1.3873255923390388, 0.47377537488937377, 0.21383463342984518, 2.207274913787842], [2.813410758972168, 1.7719568014144897, 0.5798183679580688, 1.8325815200805664, 0.17435334622859955, 3.888466453552246, 2.7748730778694153, 1.156140249222517, 0.047839793066183724, 1.1394343376159668], [4.446565155811453, 0.18859116980755003, 2.4096832285504126, 1.7609878105613013, 4.605170185988091, 0.8538295622504187, 2.5494451709255714, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 0.13800567301944372], [4.605170185988091, 2.1439800628174073, 3.242592351485517, 3.0602707946915624, 4.605170185988091, 0.5893503868783018, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 0.3522205935893521]], "target_roberta_idx": [31, 41, 62, 113, 138, 144, 249, 250, 278, 280], "target_prob_idx": [30, 40, 61, 112, 137, 143, 244, 245, 272, 274]}
{"text": "In recent years, significant changes have occurred in family structures and roles, and these changes have had both positive and negative effects. One of the most notable changes is the increasing number of single-parent households, blended families, and same-sex parents. This shift has been driven by factors such as divorce, remarriage, and the increasing acceptance of non-traditional family structures. While some people may view these changes as positive, others may see them as negative, as they can lead to emotional and financial challenges for family members. Another significant change is the changing role of gender within families. Traditionally, men were seen as the breadwinners and women as the caregivers, but today, many women are pursuing careers outside the home and becoming the primary breadwinners, while men are taking on more domestic responsibilities. This shift has been driven by the rising cost of living, the need for financial independence, and the desire for greater gender equality. Additionally, the concept of extended families has also evolved. With the rise of nuclear families and the decreasing size of family households, the role of extended families has become less important. This can be both positive and negative, as while it allows for more independence and self-sufficiency, it can also lead to a loss of social support and connection to one's heritage. In my own experience, I have seen the impact of these changes firsthand. As a child of a single mother, I have witnessed the challenges that come with being raised in a non-traditional family structure.

{"text": "In recent years, there have been significant changes in the family structure and roles. The traditional nuclear family, consisting of a father, mother, and children, has been replaced by a diverse range of family types, including single-parent households, same-sex parent households, and blended families. Additionally, gender roles have evolved, with more women entering the workforce and taking on roles traditionally held by men. While these changes have brought about positive aspects, there are also negative consequences. On the positive side, the shift in family roles has allowed for greater gender equality and provided more opportunities for women to pursue their careers. Additionally, blended families can bring together different cultures and provide a more diverse upbringing for children. However, these changes have also led to an increase in single-parent households, which can result in financial struggles and a lack of support for children. Furthermore, the breakdown of traditional family structures can lead to a lack of stability for children, as they may have to adjust to changing households and family dynamics. In conclusion, the changes in family structure and roles have brought about both positive and negative consequences. While the shift towards greater gender equality and diverse family structures is positive, the increase in single-parent households and instability for children are negative consequences.

{"text": "In recent years, the family structure and roles have undergone significant changes. Traditionally, families consisted of a nuclear unit with a clear division of roles, where the father was the breadwinner and the mother was responsible for the household and childcare. However, societal developments and shifting gender norms have led to the emergence of diverse family structures and more equal distribution of roles. One key change in family structure is the rise of single-parent households. Divorce rates have increased, leading to more families being headed by a single parent. Additionally, there has been a rise in same-sex couples and blended families, where parents from previous relationships come together to form a new family unit. These changes reflect a more inclusive and diverse society, allowing individuals to form families based on love and companionship rather than adhering to traditional norms. Alongside changes in structure, family roles have also evolved. Women are now more likely to pursue careers outside the home, challenging the traditional notion of the male breadwinner. This has led to a more equal distribution of roles within families, with fathers taking on greater responsibilities in terms of childcare and household chores. This shift has proven beneficial for both men and women, as it allows for a better work-life balance and promotes gender equality within the family unit. Overall, I believe these changes in family structure and roles are largely positive. Firstly, they promote equality and diversity, allowing individuals to form families based on their own preferences and circumstances. This can lead to stronger and more fulfilling relationships, as families are built on love and shared values rather than societal expectations.

{"text": "The family structure and roles have evolved significantly over the years, reflecting the broader socio-economic changes taking place across the world. Traditionally, families were often large, with several generations living under one roof, and roles were clearly defined, with men predominantly acting as breadwinners and women as homemakers. However, this dynamic has seen a dramatic shift. One of the most noticeable changes is the rise of the nuclear family, where the typical household consists of parents and their children. This is in contrast to the extended family model that included grandparents, aunts, uncles, and cousins. Additionally, there has been a surge in single-parent families, childless couples, and same-sex households, all of which challenge the conventional notion of what a family 'should' look like. Another significant change is the role women play in the family. With increased access to education and the workforce, women are no longer confined to domestic duties. They are now major contributors to the family's income and often share financial responsibilities with their partners. Similarly, men are taking on more active roles in child-rearing and housework, leading to a more balanced division of labor within the household. I consider these changes to be generally positive. The move towards more egalitarian family structures has allowed individuals greater freedom to pursue their ambitions, both personally and professionally. Women's participation in the workforce has not only empowered them but has also benefited economies. Moreover, the involvement of fathers in child-rearing has positive impacts on children's development. However, these changes also come with challenges.

The first part of our analysis focuses on the distribution of water resources across the globe. This is a very important issue because it affects the availability of drinking water for all people. In particular, it determines whether or not there are enough sources available for everyone to have access to clean water. We begin with an overview of the global distribution of water resources. We then examine the different types of water resources (surface, groundwater, surface-water, ground-water) and their relative importance. Finally, we discuss the role of these resources in the overall functioning of the water cycle. 1.

In the first region (the blue area) most people had access to plenty of fresh water but this situation changed dramatically during the 1960s when dams were built across large river systems.

This essay aims to encapsulate the significant trends and contrast the disparities in water provision between the two areas. **Overview** Overall, it is apparent from the charts that Region A had a higher volume of water supply compared to Region B. However, Region B exhibited superior water quality, indicating a divergence in supply characteristics between the two regions.", "label": "gpt-4-1106-preview", "label_int": 7, "est_prob_list": [[4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091], [3.454809546470642, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 3.912022829055786, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 3.9120230674743652], [3.0114528111049106, 0.7105560660362243, 4.605170185988091, 0.3955484367907047, 0.005025163292884827, 2.9124317509787425, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 0.2929690203496388, 3.5065579414367676], [4.093238966805594, 0.9197245597839355, 4.605170185988091, 3.8038478679955006, 0.5401406353339553, 3.65311176436288, 1.656593143939972, 4.605170185988091, 0.42489645736558096, 4.605170185988091], [3.336336476462228, 0.7117347955703736, 4.605170185988091, 3.829359792172909, 0.05658435635268688, 2.4397579601832797, 2.8274961709976196, 4.605170185988091, 0.25695180892944336, 4.605170185988091], [2.2493405784752336, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 3.147282171681192, 4.605170185988091, 1.1884686177899708, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 3.5992672954242493, 2.1439800628174073], [3.7534179752515073, 4.605170185988091, 3.7534179752515073, 0.4036227663936524, 4.605170185988091, 1.4508328822574619, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 0.15956411279914667, 1.556193397915288]], "target_roberta_idx": [27, 43, 45, 57, 66, 84, 85, 95, 138, 148], "target_prob_idx": [24, 38, 41, 52, 61, 82, 83, 93, 137, 147]}
{"text": "The amount of waste people produce can be quite shocking, with every person generating kilograms of rubbish in a single day, and all this can be difficult to manage. This has given some people the idea that there should be a limitation on the amount of rubbish produced per household; however, opinions are divided as to whether this would be the the most effective option.Having a limitation on the amount of waste produced sounds like a fine solution to a significant problem, with over two hundred and fifty million tons being generated in 2016 by the U.S. alone. Taxing households that break limits would push people to produce less waste and make them more mindful of what can be recycled or composted. However, forcing people to produce less waste might not be attainable.Households produce as much waste as they need to live their lifestyles. The waste people generate is only a result of the products they purchase, and will most likely wish to continue to purchase. Taxing people may be a cause of resentment, with many of them already struggling to pay their usual bills. In addition, if people produce more than they are allowed, this will encourage littering and dumping, so that they are not caught with more waste than entitled, and this in turn will damage the environment.Though controlling the amount of waste produced is important, there could be other ways of encouraging lesser output. In my opinion, governments should encourage composting and recycling, which will also reduce wasted material. People should also be more aware of what waste they produce and how it can be reduced. An education drive on these issues would perhaps be more likely to succeed in reducing rubbish than imposing limitations.", "label": "human", "label_int": 0, "est_prob_list": [[4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091], [3.9120230674743652, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 3.945405900478363, 4.605170185988091, 4.081700005625363, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091], [1.6125953264085122, 4.605170185988091, 0.11653383076190948, 1.6584811794488583, 1.1374852803265674, 2.550122844027771, 1.0624571442604065, 3.6251618219837716, 2.2980820422605452, 1.1180856674909592], [0.3566749347373843, 4.605170185988091, 0.16671268870481157, 0.7812309973303762, 0.28768208622932434, 3.471539730538036, 1.7525847274504431, 3.468013032553106, 2.9632474695796507, 1.5765369236469269], [2.5258967710061695, 3.1812414934362208, 0.172300538688785, 2.1619188484428395, 0.505331679044105, 2.0851099506020545, 0.6292402669787407, 2.4788395271324797, 2.7877604295899325, 1.4377562701702118], [0.2929040164329326, 3.9357395320454622, 3.4657359027997265, 0.39188584998178355, 0.9913005528790216, 3.4657359027997265, 1.1631508098056809, 0.6623755218931916, 4.446565155811453, 4.605170185988091], [0.14250006260728304, 4.1588830833596715, 0.808978996085067, 0.43318965612301924, 1.4847344339331432, 3.242592351485517, 2.2129729343043585, 0.5893503868783018, 1.9075912847531766, 4.605170185988091]], "target_roberta_idx": [30, 33, 104, 142, 160, 199, 214, 221, 235, 325], "target_prob_idx": [29, 32, 101, 134, 147, 185, 200, 207, 220, 307]}

{"text": "The garbage problem is one that has been around since humans first started to live in cities. In fact, there are many different types of waste we produce as human beings. We produce food which needs to be disposed of properly; clothes need to be washed and ironed before they go into landfill sites; paper products such as newspapers also require disposal after use; plastic bottles and cans must be recycled so that they don't end up polluting our oceans; furniture and other items need to be reupholstered if they become worn out; electronic equipment like computers, televisions and mobile phones all contain toxic substances that will eventually leak into the environment when discarded; and finally, some people just leave their homes empty most of the time because they feel too lazy to clean them! All these things add up to make an enormous pile of rubbish every day. This means that more landfills are needed to store the rubbish produced by each person. The only way to solve this problem would be to impose limits on how much rubbish each individual produces. If everyone was limited to producing no more than X number of kilos per week then less space would be required to dispose of the rubbish generated by each person. However, I think that imposing limits on the amount of rubbish people can generate is not fair. It seems unfair to me that someone who works hard to earn money could be prevented from disposing of his/her earnings simply because he/she cannot afford to pay extra taxes. On top of that, limiting the amount of rubbish people can create does nothing to reduce pollution caused by manufacturing processes.", "label": "gpt-j-6b", "label_int": 2, "est_prob_list": [[4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 3.9120230674743652, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091], [4.605170185988091, 2.8145863749086857, 3.2188758850097656, 2.813410758972168, 2.97612202167511, 3.5065579414367676, 2.995732069015503, 3.781211018562317, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091], [0.0, 2.240680068731308, 0.7803238034248352, 1.1394343376159668, 0.5405574838320414, 1.4271163940429688, 2.995732307434082, 2.3552653789520264, 0.5318520069122314, 1.966112732887268], [0.010050326585769653, 2.0026818364858627, 1.7532789707183838, 1.3862943649291992, 1.5675208767255147, 0.5447272062301636, 4.605170185988091, 2.649158477783203, 0.48158912658691405, 4.605170185988091], [0.0, 2.024257428944111, 1.1512925624847412, 0.8439701795578003, 0.8246950805187225, 1.4271163940429688, 1.8971198797225952, 2.6015034914016724, 0.3685263693332672, 2.525728464126587], [4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 0.11145544092532282, 0.8446970786871463, 0.29815337231907635, 4.605170185988091, 0.8266785731844679, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 1.2966822024302034], [4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 0.1980699137620938, 1.556193397915288, 0.2569104137850272, 4.605170185988091, 2.5494451709255714, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 3.4657359027997265]], "target_roberta_idx": [56, 58, 85, 107, 118, 150, 169, 190, 273, 274], "target_prob_idx": [54, 56, 83, 100, 110, 142, 161, 180, 262, 263]}
{"text": "I somewhat disagree with the idea of imposing a government-imposed limit on the amount of rubbish that each household can throw away. While I understand the importance of reducing waste and conserving the environment, I believe that such a limit could have unintended consequences and may not be the most effective solution to the problem. Firstly, implementing a strict limit on waste disposal could lead to unrealistic expectations and burdens on households. For example, if a household is allowed to produce only a certain amount of waste per month, they may be forced to carefully ration their trash and avoid generating any unnecessary waste, which could lead to unnecessary stress and inconvenience. Furthermore, households with more members or those who generate more waste due to their lifestyle or profession may find it difficult to adhere to the limit, leading to feelings of unfairness and resentment. Secondly, a government-imposed limit on waste disposal may not address the root causes of waste generation. Waste is often a byproduct of consumption and production, and simply reducing the amount of waste that households can throw away does not address the underlying issues of overconsumption and wastefulness. Instead of focusing solely on waste reduction, I believe that governments should focus on promoting sustainable consumption practices, such as recycling, composting, and reducing packaging waste. Finally, imposing a limit on waste disposal could lead to unintended consequences such as increased illegal dumping or the transportation of waste to other areas.

{"text": "In recent years, the increasing amount of waste generated by households has become a major concern for governments worldwide. To address this issue, some people argue that every household should be subject to a government-imposed limit on the amount of rubbish they can throw away. In this essay, I will discuss both the advantages and disadvantages of this proposal and give my opinion on the matter. On the one hand, imposing limits on the amount of waste households can generate has several benefits. Firstly, it would encourage people to be more mindful of their waste production and reduce the amount of rubbish sent to landfills. This would not only help to conserve space in landfills but also reduce the emission of harmful greenhouse gases. Secondly, it would encourage households to adopt more sustainable practices, such as recycling and composting, which would further reduce their waste output. Finally, by making households more responsible for their waste, it would increase awareness of the environmental impact of their actions and promote a culture of sustainability. On the other hand, there are also some potential drawbacks to this proposal. One concern is that it could be difficult to enforce, particularly in densely populated areas where waste collection is already a challenge. Additionally, some households may find it difficult or expensive to reduce their waste output to the proposed limit, which could lead to resentment and resistance. Finally, there is the potential for unintended consequences, such as an increase in illegal dumping or the creation of black markets for waste.", "label": "vicuna-13b-v1.5", "label_int": 4, "est_prob_list": [[4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.110065119607108, 4.605170185988091, 4.374121189117432, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091], [4.238966147104899, 3.244691276550293, 3.159736548151289, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 3.1579224159941077, 4.605170185988091, 3.9120230674743652, 3.9120230674743652], [4.605170185988091, 3.726280403137207, 4.605170185988091, 0.02020268701016903, 1.610218346118927, 1.272965669631958, 0.48599655628204347, 1.0656513145991735, 0.0, 1.3267809748649597], [3.07011349995931, 4.127408027648926, 4.605170185988091, 0.010050326585769653, 2.9289352769653, 0.4004775285720825, 0.3391153931617737, 1.9207359382084437, 0.010050326585769653, 1.2609928101301193], [2.6080153783162436, 0.8190447350012184, 4.605170185988091, 0.007152511542209762, 2.1069231430689492, 0.3475932348964481, 0.19444004595279693, 0.1459859779902867, 0.0, 0.5950349345803261], [4.446565155811453, 1.9075912847531766, 1.2411123512753928, 3.9357395320454622, 1.5748855309274405, 2.9802280870180256, 0.7830035096818063, 1.2411123512753928, 1.102526187989246, 2.7119641004233466], [4.605170185988091, 0.9400072584914712, 1.9075912847531766, 3.4657359027997265, 3.0602707946915624, 4.605170185988091, 1.6739764335716716, 2.4541349911212467, 0.7088955375280844, 3.4657359027997265]], "target_roberta_idx": [32, 41, 58, 68, 84, 90, 158, 190, 216, 217], "target_prob_idx": [31, 38, 55, 65, 81, 87, 151, 182, 208, 209]}
{"text": "I strongly agree with the idea of government-imposed limits on household rubbish. The current amount of waste produced by households across the world is becoming an increasingly serious problem, with many countries already facing significant environmental issues due to rubbish. In order to reduce the amount of waste being produced, governments must take action and impose limits on the amount of rubbish households can throw away.  One of the key benefits of imposing limits on household rubbish is that it will force households to become more mindful of the waste they produce. This can lead to the adoption of more sustainable practices, such as recycling, composting, and reducing the amount of single-use items being used. By making households more aware of their waste, they will be more likely to take steps to reduce it, thus benefiting the environment.  Furthermore, imposing limits on household rubbish can also help reduce the amount of waste being sent to landfills and other waste management facilities. This can help reduce the environmental impact of these facilities, as well as reduce the amount of money being spent on waste management.  In conclusion, imposing limits on household rubbish is an effective way of reducing the amount of waste being produced and improving environmental conditions.

While it is important to address the issue of waste management and promote sustainable practices, such a policy would be impractical and could lead to unintended consequences. Firstly, implementing a government-imposed limit on rubbish would be challenging to enforce. It would require a significant amount of resources and manpower to monitor the waste output of every household. This would place an unnecessary burden on the government and could result in increased costs for taxpayers. Additionally, it may lead to conflicts and disputes between households and authorities, as determining the exact amount of rubbish each household is producing would be subjective and difficult to measure accurately. Moreover, such a policy may not be fair or effective in reducing waste. Different households have varying needs and circumstances, and imposing a one-size-fits-all limit may not account for these differences. For example, larger families or households with medical conditions may generate more waste due to their specific requirements. Imposing limits on them could lead to increased stress and inconvenience, without necessarily reducing overall waste production. Instead of imposing limits, the government should focus on promoting and incentivizing sustainable waste management practices. This could include initiatives such as providing subsidies for composting or recycling facilities, educating the public on the importance of reducing waste, and encouraging the use of eco-friendly packaging materials.

{"text": "It is a widely held view that to manage waste more effectively, governments should enforce limits on the quantity of trash each household can dispose of. While this may seem like a practical solution to the burgeoning waste problem, I believe that it would be an impractical and potentially unfair policy to implement, and hence, I disagree with the proposition to a large extent. Firstly, imposing a strict limit on rubbish disposal could disproportionately affect larger families or those with specific needs that naturally produce more waste. For example, households with infants or elderly members often have additional waste due to items like diapers or medical products that cannot be easily reduced. Implementing a one-size-fits-all policy fails to consider these nuances and could unfairly penalize such families. Secondly, the enforcement of such limits could lead to unintended consequences, such as illegal dumping. If households are restricted by how much they can throw away, some might resort to disposing of their excess waste in unauthorized areas to avoid penalties, leading to environmental degradation and increased clean-up costs for local authorities. Instead of imposing strict waste limits, governments should focus on encouraging recycling and composting, providing better waste separation facilities, and educating the public on reducing waste. For instance, cities like San Francisco have achieved high levels of waste diversion from landfills by implementing comprehensive recycling programs and incentivizing waste reduction. Moreover, companies should be encouraged to minimize packaging and produce more durable goods, thus lessening the waste burden on consumers.

Additionally, Ravenna offered the Romans protection from barbarian invasions that were increasing in frequency at the time. The Romans also chose Ravenna because it was seen as a more secure location than Rome, which had become increasingly vulnerable to barbarian attacks. The move of the capital also signified a shift in the Roman Empire, as it marked the beginning of the decline of the Roman power in the region.

The shift of the capital to Ravenna occurred during the latter period of the Western Roman Empire, specifically under the reign of Emperor Honorius in 402 AD. Several reasons contributed to this relocation: 1. **Military Security**: Rome was increasingly vulnerable to barbarian invasions. In 410 AD, the city was sacked by the Visigoths under Alaric I. Ravenna, on the other hand, was more defensible due to its location amidst marshes and its access to the Adriatic Sea, which allowed for easier movement of troops and supplies by the navy. 2.", "label": "gpt-4-1106-preview", "label_int": 7, "est_prob_list": [[4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 3.8690604865550995, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091], [4.605170185988091, 4.403990477323532, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091], [0.6733444333076477, 1.6985016614198685, 0.3011050820350647, 0.19466985762119293, 2.892433305581411, 1.1086626052856445, 1.6607311964035034, 1.216655472914378, 0.3285040259361267, 2.95711702770657], [0.9416084885597229, 1.7655678540468216, 0.47803568840026855, 0.29829386435449123, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 0.7985076308250427, 0.5711830308039983, 0.11653383076190948, 0.9480052755938636], [0.5798183679580688, 1.2805503904819489, 0.3856624662876129, 0.31407158076763153, 2.1951016187667847, 2.525728702545166, 0.6539263725280762, 0.6947938402493795, 0.7765287756919861, 2.4761411084069147], [0.20284319251475147, 4.605170185988091, 1.9616585060234524, 4.605170185988091, 2.2870809064580806, 0.38612214526503347, 3.347952867143343, 4.605170185988091, 2.2870809064580806, 3.912023005428146], [0.1070981355563671, 4.605170185988091, 2.6548056865833978, 0.17018239425348655, 4.605170185988091, 0.28235807354032144, 4.605170185988091, 2.4541349911212467, 0.0667186835789244, 4.605170185988091]], "target_roberta_idx": [27, 28, 38, 41, 52, 82, 88, 89, 90, 98], "target_prob_idx": [25, 26, 36, 38, 49, 80, 84, 85, 86, 94]}

Many people find solace and comfort in the presence of animals, especially during times of loneliness, stress, or sadness. Animals are non-judgmental and offer unconditional love, which can be incredibly comforting for humans. Second, animals have the ability to understand and respond to human emotions. They can sense when their human companion is feeling down or upset and often provide comfort by offering physical affection or simply being present. This ability to empathize with human emotions creates a strong bond between humans and animals. Third, animals can serve as a source of entertainment and joy.

Shampoo can be formulated for different hair types and can contain ingredients such as sulfates, which create a lather, and conditioning agents, which help to moisturize the hair. Conditioner is a product that is used to moisturize and detangle hair after it has been shampooed. It is applied to the hair and left in for a few minutes before being rinsed out. Conditioner can also contain ingredients that help to repair and protect the hair, such as silicones and vitamins. Body soap is a cleansing product that is used to clean the skin. It can be used on the face, body, and hands, and is typically lathered up and rinsed off. Body soap can contain a variety of ingredients, such as moisturizers, fragrances, and antibacterial agents. 2-in-1 and 3-in-1 products are personal care products that combine two or three functions into one product.", "label": "vicuna-13b-v1.5", "label_int": 4, "est_prob_list": [[4.605170185988091, 3.9120230674743652, 3.9120230674743652, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 3.9120230674743652, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091], [2.6592600345611572, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.193190634250641, 1.8789572815100353, 2.813410758972168, 2.813410758972168, 2.3025851249694824, 3.5065579414367676, 4.605170185988091], [0.36806770733424593, 0.3011050820350647, 0.3011050820350647, 0.11073920875787735, 1.2678894698619843, 0.010050326585769653, 0.010050326585769653, 0.04082195460796356, 0.0, 0.060779497027397156], [0.16420953827244894, 0.2744367718696594, 0.2744367718696594, 0.2562471805140376, 4.605170185988091, 0.16251890361309052, 0.16251890361309052, 2.1202635765075684, 0.0, 0.12704061809927225], [0.13050405352486716, 0.6931471824645996, 0.21377475019908185, 0.08402607088710407, 1.2095594443380833, 0.0, 0.0, 0.031138740846377994, 0.0, 0.0], [1.2966822024302034, 1.067840630001356, 1.467640000573843, 4.605170185988091, 3.5992672954242493, 0.8817383503674954, 1.9898293829901488, 0.5547448577008262, 4.1588830833596715, 1.2685113254635072], [1.807507826196194, 0.29815337231907635, 1.8562979903656263, 4.605170185988091, 3.242592351485517, 2.367123614131617, 1.114360645636249, 1.2685113254635072, 4.605170185988091, 1.9616585060234524]], "target_roberta_idx": [34, 56, 57, 91, 149, 161, 162, 182, 216, 254], "target_prob_idx": [23, 44, 45, 76, 127, 136, 137, 155, 186, 212]}

{"text": "Mexican labourers living in the US sent a record $16.6bn (\u00a38.82bn) home last year. The Bank of Mexico said that remittances grew 24% last year and now represent the country's second-biggest source of income after oil. Better records and greater prosperity of Mexican expatriates in the US are the main reasons behind the increase. About 10 million Mexicans live in the US, where there are 16 million citizens of Mexican origin. Remittances now represent more than 2% of the country's GDP, according to the Bank of Mexico's figures. Last year, there were 50.9 million transactions, with an average value of $327 per remittance, the bank said. According to Standard & Poor's, which has recently upgraded Mexico's sovereign debt rating, the rise in remittances helps protect the Mexican economy against a potential fall in the international oil prices. The growth in remittances has sparked fierce competition between banks. Bank of America announced last week that it planned to eliminate transfer fees for some customers. Remittance charges are estimated to have dropped by between 50 and 60%, reports from the US Treasury and the Inter-American Development Bank have said. The Inter-American Development Bank estimates that remittances to Latin America and the Caribbean reached $45bn in 2004.", "label": "human", "label_int": 0, "est_prob_list": [[4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 3.574822703997294, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091], [4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 3.9744654735903406, 3.9120230674743652, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 3.750035426833413], [1.06311152734057, 0.0427734162696302, 0.3493233687230885, 0.08338159322738647, 0.09573946680341448, 4.317602204300766, 0.8693384594387479, 0.0, 0.04863898968324065, 1.2031415165825323], [0.6019864082336426, 0.0625214690216993, 1.3684148885876353, 0.027114752842512756, 0.27893551492265295, 3.2865421351021737, 1.0574953655878236, 0.0, 0.061283381655812263, 0.6102979156104001], [0.8110245439295102, 0.22824221973617873, 1.1029982216488983, 0.14889518813578098, 0.3825534761242896, 2.9308297404599446, 0.9072328868175878, 0.0064294724188720676, 0.025746445359883123, 0.9480615094249261], [3.7534179752515073, 4.446565155811453, 2.7119641004233466, 0.38039147055604844, 4.605170185988091, 3.7534179752515073, 4.605170185988091, 0.39188584998178355, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091], [3.0602707946915624, 1.9616585060234524, 3.242592351485517, 0.2076393647782445, 4.605170185988091, 2.906120114864304, 2.6548056865833978, 0.27731928541623435, 2.1439800628174073, 4.605170185988091]], "target_roberta_idx": [31, 43, 67, 148, 171, 173, 208, 220, 221, 252], "target_prob_idx": [22, 32, 51, 127, 148, 150, 183, 194, 195, 223]}

Bush's administration and Congress on Thursday as part of an effort to convince them that Mexico is not responsible for illegal immigration into the U.S., according to reports published by several newspapers. The visit comes after weeks of tension between Washington and its southern neighbor over border security issues. Mexico says it wants more help from the U.S. to stem the flow of migrants who cross through their territory en route north to the U.S.-Mexico border. But many Mexicans are angry at what they see as unfair treatment by American authorities. \"We have been very patient,\" said Jose Luis de la Cruz, head of the Mexican embassy in Washington. \"But we can't stand this anymore.\" De La Cruz told reporters he would be meeting with top White House officials including Vice-President Dick Cheney, Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff and Attorney General Alberto Gonzales.

{"text": "Mexican nationals living in the United States sent home a record $16 billion in remittances last year, according to data from the Mexican central bank. The figure represents an increase of 8% on the previous year, and is the highest level of remittances from the US to Mexico on record. The majority of the money was sent through official channels, such as banks and money transfer companies, with an estimated $2 billion sent through informal channels, such as friends and family. Remittances from Mexican nationals in the US have been steadily increasing over the past decade, and are now the country's largest source of foreign income. The money is often used to support families and communities in Mexico, and is a vital source of income for many people. The increase in remittances is likely due to a combination of factors, including an increase in the number of Mexican nationals living in the US, and an increase in the average amount of money sent per person.

{"text": "Mexican Immigrants in the United States Send Record-Breaking $16 Billion Home Mexican immigrants living and working in the United States have sent a staggering $16 billion back to Mexico in the past year, marking a significant increase compared to previous years. This surge in remittances highlights the vital role that these funds play in supporting the Mexican economy and the financial well-being of millions of families. According to data released by Mexico's central bank, the remittances sent in the past year have surpassed the previous record of $36 billion, set in 2019. Experts attribute this increase to various factors, including a rebound in the US economy and a rise in employment opportunities for Mexican workers. Remittances are a critical source of income for many Mexican households, helping to alleviate poverty and provide essential support for education, healthcare, and housing. They also contribute to local economies, particularly in rural areas where job opportunities are limited. The COVID-19 pandemic had initially disrupted remittance flows as job losses and economic uncertainty affected many Mexican immigrants in the US. However, the recent surge in remittances indicates a remarkable recovery and resilience within this community.

Uefa spokesman Rob Faulkner said: \"People in England have bad memories of the artificial pitches of Luton and QPR in the 1980s, but the latest generation are completely different and are much more like grass. \"We have sanctioned its use from the start of next season but only as long as it is the latest generation of artificial turf and meets a whole series of standards.\" Several leading clubs from Scandinavia, Russia and eastern Europe - especially those who only play Champions League or Uefa Cup matches in winter - are now expected to instal artificial pitches.", "label": "human", "label_int": 0, "est_prob_list": [[4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091], [4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091], [0.6477643730211221, 2.2291978322851658, 1.123492990221296, 4.605170185988091, 2.2301456689834596, 4.605170185988091, 0.04840178291002909, 3.5065579414367676, 4.605170185988091, 2.5075377449393272], [0.8435541920077342, 4.178883355630309, 0.8849592838419166, 4.605170185988091, 2.285339903831482, 3.176970077885522, 0.05693633109331131, 1.698931870092248, 4.39429634809494, 3.361500999144873], [0.7483847618389589, 0.5450773135155452, 1.839357512337821, 3.9120230674743652, 2.7589881624189867, 4.605170185988091, 0.06900970076920165, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 3.4704219830265366], [4.605170185988091, 0.3522205935893521, 4.446565155811453, 4.446565155811453, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 2.600738465313122, 4.605170185988091], [4.605170185988091, 0.7411563997463059, 2.772588722239781, 2.772588722239781, 4.1588830833596715, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 2.4541349911212467, 3.242592351485517]], "target_roberta_idx": [51, 59, 62, 103, 110, 145, 152, 189, 197, 248], "target_prob_idx": [45, 53, 56, 95, 101, 132, 137, 169, 177, 228]}

Uefa says it is \"an important step forward\" towards making stadiums more environmentally friendly. But critics say the move could lead to an increase in injuries among players who are not used to running on such surfaces. They also argue that there should be no change until safety tests have been carried out on existing pitches. A new study suggests that people with diabetes may suffer brain damage as they age because glucose levels rise too high during sleep. Researchers found evidence of nerve cell death in mice whose blood sugar rose above normal while asleep. In humans, this would mean that someone with type 2 diabetes - which affects about one-third of adults over 65 years old - might experience memory loss or dementia later in life.

{"text": "Uefa, the governing body of football in Europe, has approved the use of artificial grass for its competitions. The move comes after years of debate over the use of fake grass in professional football, with some arguing that it is not as good for the players as natural grass. However, Uefa has concluded that artificial grass is now of a high enough quality to be used in its competitions. The organisation said that it had carried out extensive testing of the fake grass, and had found that it met all of the necessary safety and performance standards. The use of artificial grass will be limited to certain areas of the pitch, such as the goal mouth and the penalty area, where it is most likely to be damaged by heavy use. Natural grass will still be used for the rest of the pitch.

{"text": "UEFA, European football's governing body, has announced that it will permit the use of synthetic turf, often referred to as 'fake grass,' in its competitions. This decision comes after extensive testing and consultation with players, coaches, and turf specialists. The approval was granted based on the high-quality standards that the latest generation synthetic turf can meet, which, according to UEFA, can now closely replicate the playing characteristics of natural grass. The move is seen as a way to ensure more consistent playing surfaces across various climates and seasons, especially in regions where maintaining natural grass at an elite standard is challenging due to weather conditions. UEFA's decision also takes into account the potential cost savings for clubs and national associations, as synthetic pitches require less maintenance than natural grass and can withstand a higher frequency of matches and training sessions. This could be particularly beneficial for grassroots and community football programs that struggle with the financial demands of pitch upkeep. However, UEFA has stipulated strict criteria that these artificial surfaces must meet, including player safety, ball interaction, and surface durability.

There also seemed to be an increase in the number of customers who felt satisfied with their stay (from 58% to 68%, p=0.03), although this difference did not reach statistical significance.

{"text": "The two charts provided display the results of a questionnaire conducted in 2005 and 2010, which aimed to gather the opinions of visitors to the Parkway Hotel regarding the hotel's customer service. The questionnaire consisted of five multiple-choice questions, with each question having five possible answers ranging from \"very poor\" to \"excellent\". Upon analyzing the data, it can be observed that the overall satisfaction of the guests with the hotel's customer service improved significantly from 2005 to 2010.

{"text": "In order to understand how the French population has changed over time, it is necessary to look at the demographic trends that have taken place in France since the end of World War II. The following chart shows the number of births per 1,000 people from 1940 to 1980. It also shows the percentage change in this rate during these years. As can be seen from the above chart, there was a sharp decline in the birthrate between 1940 and 1960. This decline continued until 1970 when the birthrate began to increase again. However, by 1980 the birthrate had fallen back to its pre-war level. Since then, the birthrate has been increasing steadily. In fact, the average annual growth rate (AOGR) of the birthrate in France since 1950 has been 2.6%.

{"text": "In both countries there are more people aged between 15-24 than any other group. In fact, this is true of all developed nations. This can be explained by looking at the birth rate (the number of children born to each woman) which has been falling steadily since 1950. The fall was most rapid after 1960 when it dropped from about 3.5 per women to 2.4. It then fell further to 1.9 in 1980. However, even though fertility rates have fallen, they remain higher than those found in many developing countries such as China or Brazil where the average family size is only two children. This means that although population growth will slow down over time, it will not stop completely until the total fertility rate falls below replacement level.

{"text": "There are a couple reasons for this. The \"official\" reason (meaning the one that Scientology published) is that the church is against all of the abuse and ridicule that the \"mentally ill\" have been subjected to over the last couple hundred years. They believe that psychiatry has no scientific background and is simply trying to distract and sedate people as a means of \"curing\" them. But, from a religious anthropological stance, the reason why they are opposed is because they are rivals for the same desire. They both want clients. People often turn to religion as a means of feeling included or \"fixing what is broken\" in their life or themselves or their relationships.

Scientology sees psychiatry as a threat to their religion and an obstacle to their goal of helping people, so they have been vocal in their opposition to it.", "label": "alpaca-7b", "label_int": 5, "est_prob_list": [[4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 3.912022829055786, 3.912022829055786, 4.605170185988091], [2.3025851249694824, 2.3025851249694824, 2.3025851249694824, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 1.9661128520965576, 2.6023972162178586, 0.7133498787879944, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091], [0.937803586324056, 0.0, 0.010050326585769653, 4.605170185988091, 2.74196559055285, 0.6546666622161865, 0.8449290820530483, 0.9371961995959281, 1.5141277313232422, 0.15082287788391113], [0.44497927641598367, 0.0, 0.030459178611636162, 1.3774734362865189, 0.6083391139527576, 0.35808643127157075, 0.33118540048599243, 0.12323721647262573, 0.10360980231013087, 0.10698710009680805], [0.6108604669570923, 0.0, 0.08338159322738647, 4.605170185988091, 2.749424857172099, 1.0601317882537842, 1.1067264420645577, 0.312129545211792, 1.6094378232955933, 0.12783338129520416], [0.5964175541013942, 4.1588830833596715, 0.4514272436728001, 3.5992672954242493, 4.605170185988091, 0.639902666041133, 1.1631508098056809, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 1.1884686177899708], [0.7248958788745256, 3.0602707946915624, 0.4953214372300254, 2.2870809064580806, 4.605170185988091, 0.6473376445286511, 2.1439800628174073, 4.605170185988091, 2.906120114864304, 0.8266785731844679]], "target_roberta_idx": [40, 41, 42, 50, 51, 62, 63, 81, 107, 112], "target_prob_idx": [37, 38, 39, 47, 48, 59, 60, 78, 101, 106]}
{"text": "Scientology opposes psychiatry vehemently because of its core beliefs and teachings. According to Scientology, the mind is immortal and spiritual in nature, and mental health issues are considered spiritual in nature rather than medical or psychological. They believe that psychiatry is a pseudoscience that seeks to suppress and control individuals, rather than genuinely help them. One of the main reasons for Scientology's opposition to psychiatry is its founder L. Ron Hubbard's personal experiences with psychiatric treatments. Hubbard was critical of the psychiatric practices he encountered during his life, including his own experiences in psychiatric institutions. He claimed to have been mistreated and witnessed the mistreatment of others, which led him to develop a deep distrust of psychiatrists and their methods. Additionally, Scientology believes that psychiatry is a tool used by a larger conspiracy to manipulate and control individuals and society.", "label": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "label_int": 6, "est_prob_list": [[4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 3.151129013299942, 3.5065579414367676, 4.605170185988091, 3.5065579414367676, 3.5065579414367676, 4.605170185988091, 3.5065579414367676, 3.0246726989746096], [4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 2.552186143398285, 3.912022829055786, 2.525728464126587, 3.9120230674743652, 3.9120230674743652, 3.808438092470169, 3.5065579414367676, 3.3176198959350587], [0.12396858798133002, 0.08108137051264445, 1.0333526372909545, 2.1202633380889893, 0.10253701265901327, 0.24846132099628448, 0.010050326585769653, 0.5565093757415359, 0.0, 2.1192893862724302], [0.2142569257153405, 0.1488602745036284, 0.7410369396209717, 0.28768208622932434, 0.46682219207286835, 0.4620353579521179, 0.10536054521799088, 0.051262019710107284, 0.010050326585769653, 4.605170185988091], [0.22248746620284188, 0.1334924797217051, 0.5071305572986603, 4.605170185988091, 0.3394631836563349, 0.17435327172279358, 0.010050326585769653, 0.309671857140281, 0.010050326585769653, 1.899566888809204], [3.242592351485517, 0.11430043241871621, 2.2493405784752336, 0.05231912359896457, 1.556193397915288, 0.1762036262969983, 3.0602707946915624, 0.052665350860471596, 0.0038732431501452315, 1.2317647901161983], [4.605170185988091, 0.34117075740276714, 3.4657359027997265, 0.561570822771226, 1.6739764335716716, 2.6548056865833978, 4.605170185988091, 2.4541349911212467, 2.2129729343043585, 4.605170185988091]], "target_roberta_idx": [23, 25, 32, 60, 62, 68, 69, 95, 111, 137], "target_prob_idx": [21, 23, 30, 56, 58, 64, 65, 90, 106, 130]}

Hubbard posited that many mental health problems could be resolved through spiritual healing practices, specifically through the use of Scientology's own techniques, such as auditing.

{"text": "It can be a variety of reasons. Sometimes there is simply zone natural aptitude for comprehending particular topics, and I'm not sure there's any way to explain that.  Sometimes a person may have a particular interest in the subject matter, making then more engaged and more inclined and likely to think about it in more detail and more often - this strengthens the neural links created/used meaning they recall details better.  There's also the idea that when we learn things, we do so by adding them into our existing world view. Sometimes things make sense in the way we already see the world, and so they're easy to integrate; but sometimes they will cause a cognitive conflict because some of the new information doesn't make sense based on our existing understanding and experience. A good example is when someone is first introduced to the idea that in space an object will never slow down. Most often school children, since they don't understand friction properly yet, will believe something along the lines that \"the force/energy eventually runs out and the object stops\". The cognitive conflict means they will need to readjust their existing views to accommodate the new information - this can be difficult, & some are better at doing so than others.

{"text": "The answer is that there are many different types of learning. Some people have a natural aptitude for certain kinds of learning, and they can easily master those kinds of learning. Others may be able to master one kind of learning but not another. For example, if you were born with the ability to read, then it's very likely that you'll be able to read well enough to pass most high school classes. However, if you're born without this ability, then it's unlikely that you'll ever be able to read well enough to pass most college courses. Similarly, if you've been taught how to play the piano since your early childhood, then it's highly likely that you will eventually be able to play well enough to pass most music lessons. But if you were never taught how to play the piano in the first place, then you probably won't be able to play at all. The same goes for other areas of life.

{"text": "There are several reasons why some subjects may come more naturally to an individual while others are more difficult for them to learn. One reason is that people have different learning styles, such as visual, auditory, or kinesthetic, and some subjects may be better suited to their dominant learning style. For example, a person with a visual learning style may find it easier to learn subjects that involve visual aids, such as mathematics or science, while a person with an auditory learning style may find it easier to learn subjects that involve listening and speaking, such as language or history. Another reason is that people have different strengths and weaknesses, and some subjects may play to their strengths more than others. For example, a person who is naturally good at problem-solving may find it easier to learn subjects that require critical thinking, such as logic or philosophy, while a person who is more creative may find it easier to learn subjects that allow for more self-expression, such as art or music. Additionally, people may have had different experiences and exposure to certain subjects, which can affect their ability to learn them.

{"text": "I think there are several factors that can contribute to why some subjects come naturally to an individual while others are more difficult for them to learn. Firstly, a person's level of interest and motivation can play a large role in how easily they are able to grasp a concept. If a person is truly passionate about a subject, they will be more likely to invest the necessary effort to understand it. In addition, prior knowledge can also play an important role in the ease of learning something. If someone has a background in a certain area, or has had previous experience with the material, they may have an easier time understanding it. This is because they already have a framework to build upon, allowing them to make connections between the new material and what they already know. Furthermore, the way in which material is presented can also have an effect on how easily a person is able to learn it.

Some people may have a natural inclination or talent for subjects that align with their cognitive abilities or interests. For example, individuals with strong analytical skills may find math or science subjects easier, while those with strong communication skills may excel in languages or literature. Additionally, prior knowledge and experience can play a significant role in the ease of learning a subject. If an individual has a solid foundation in a particular subject, they are likely to find related topics easier to grasp. On the other hand, if a subject is completely new or unfamiliar, it may take more time and effort to understand and master it. Learning styles also contribute to the ease or difficulty of learning. Some individuals may be visual learners, while others may prefer auditory or kinesthetic learning. If the teaching methods used in a subject align with an individual's preferred learning style, they are more likely to find it easier to comprehend and retain information. Motivation and interest also play a crucial role. When an individual is genuinely interested in a subject, they are more likely to invest time and effort into learning it.

{"text": "Many people know the negative consequences of smoking. However, hey still continue this behavior. The main reason is that a cigarette has a chemical component which keeps people smoking and a vital solution to reduce smoking in public is to increase the cigarette price. With regard to this issue, Nicotine is one of the chemicals that manufacturers use to produce a cigarette and its effect causes smokers to be addicted to the compound. As a result, even though these people understand the degree of this dangerous product, they are not likely to stop using it. Furthermore, many health organizations have announced research demonstrating that the factor that hugely affects smokers to not be able to resist smoking us not a cigarette, but Nicotine. In order to counteract the situation, perhaps the most effective mitigation is for governments to set the minimum price of a cigarette on markets which is unaffordable for buyers. Consequently, this action possibly decreases the purchasing power of smokers and, subsequently, they tend to discontinue smoking. This is exemplified by the pilot project of Thai government which charge cigarette purchasers ten times higher than the market price in specific areas. After that the authorities conduct public surveys and find that more than 80% of people who used to smoke in the areas quit smoking. In conclusion, people who smoke cannot change this habit due to Nicotine in a cigarette which can be addressed by governmental policy to raise the price of a cigarette with the view to promote citizens to cease smoking and take care of their health instead.", "label": "human", "label_int": 0, "est_prob_list": [[4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 3.9120230674743652, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091], [4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 2.6592600345611572, 4.284744183222453, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091], [1.3093332052230835, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 2.525728702545166, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.5645141889034795, 1.9710076649983723, 1.4729499245406368], [1.7108886852973584, 4.605170185988091, 1.8971199989318848, 4.605170185988091, 2.1202635765075684, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 3.3058934861963447, 2.3501571814219155, 1.2816728949546814], [1.0558634566524467, 4.605170185988091, 3.9120230674743652, 4.605170185988091, 2.525728464126587, 4.605170185988091, 4.560403989378522, 3.155276558615945, 2.702803346972723, 0.9216777284940084], [4.605170185988091, 3.9357395320454622, 2.2870809064580806, 0.7411563997463059, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 0.34117075740276714, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 3.5992672954242493], [4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 1.0908301482260547, 0.8266785731844679, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 0.29815337231907635, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.1588830833596715]], "target_roberta_idx": [32, 40, 45, 64, 86, 153, 165, 192, 246, 249], "target_prob_idx": [31, 39, 44, 63, 85, 152, 163, 189, 241, 244]}

{"text": "Smoking is a very common practice among young adults. It has been proven that it leads to various health problems such as lung cancer, heart disease, emphysema etc. The main reason why most teenagers smoke cigarettes is because they want to look cool. They think that by doing so they will be accepted into their peer group. Another cause of teenage smoking is due to stress caused by school work. Teenagers feel stressed out when studying hard at school. This makes them crave for something which relaxes them. Smoking helps them deal with these stresses. In addition, some teens start smoking after watching movies where characters smoke. These films make adolescents believe that smoking is an attractive thing to do. Therefore, there should be more awareness about the harmful effects of cigarette smoking on our body. We need to inform students about the risks associated with smoking. By educating children early enough, we could prevent them from starting smoking. There are several ways through which we can educate kids about the hazards of smoking. Firstly, parents must talk to their children about the negative consequences of smoking. Secondly, schools should teach pupils how dangerous smoking really is. Thirdly, teachers should not allow students to bring tobacco products onto school premises. Finally, anti-smoking campaigns should be conducted regularly. In conclusion, I would like to say that if we don't stop smoking now, then later on we may have serious health issues.

{"text": "The dangers of smoking are well known, yet many people continue with this habit. There are several reasons for this. Firstly, nicotine, the primary psychoactive substance in tobacco, is highly addictive. Once a person starts smoking, their brain becomes accustomed to the constant flow of nicotine, making it difficult to quit. Additionally, smoking is often a social activity, and many people enjoy the social connections they form with other smokers. Another reason for the persistence of smoking is the lack of awareness about the risks associated with it. While the dangers of smoking are well-documented, many people are not aware of the full extent of the health risks. For example, smoking is a leading cause of lung cancer, heart disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Furthermore, smoking can also harm loved ones through secondhand smoke. To reduce smoking in society, it is essential to address these underlying causes. One approach is to increase awareness about the health risks of smoking through public education campaigns and media advertising. These campaigns can highlight the personal and social costs of smoking, such as the financial burden of smoking-related illnesses and the impact on family and friends. Another approach is to implement strict regulations on tobacco products. Governments can increase taxes on cigarettes, restrict advertising, and ban smoking in public places. For example, many countries have banned smoking in restaurants, bars, and workplaces, which has led to a significant reduction in smoking rates.", "label": "Llama-2-13b-chat-hf", "label_int": 3, "est_prob_list": [[3.912022829055786, 3.912022829055786, 3.912022829055786, 3.2188758850097656, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.121091480056445, 3.2188756465911865], [3.912022829055786, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 3.912022829055786, 2.343575053744846, 1.272965669631958, 3.674237926801046, 2.525728702545166, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091], [0.0, 0.2411803247345252, 0.0559233180692329, 0.06394512400091619, 0.055504584462877926, 0.680642328487673, 0.8985990020963881, 2.207274913787842, 0.1970777635773023, 0.07133499383926392], [0.02020268701016903, 3.4944352308909097, 1.5708393275737762, 0.08784223534166813, 2.3105291061931186, 3.136263817548752, 0.3207692503929138, 1.8971198797225952, 0.9178568919499716, 0.12697566747665406], [0.0, 0.33939499656359357, 0.0650075614452362, 0.46250370765725773, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 0.13095683521694607, 0.28768208622932434, 0.667493482430776, 0.14266997575759888], [1.102526187989246, 0.5345421503833068, 2.772588722239781, 1.114360645636249, 0.2173012756899814, 0.9007865453381898, 1.4020427180880297, 3.147282171681192, 3.4657359027997265, 0.7744928200138977], [1.9075912847531766, 0.6325225587435105, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 0.07290677080808779, 1.4847344339331432, 1.4847344339331432, 1.2144441041932315, 3.4657359027997265, 0.3522205935893521]], "target_roberta_idx": [47, 74, 75, 182, 197, 198, 205, 208, 236, 285], "target_prob_idx": [45, 72, 73, 175, 190, 191, 198, 201, 227, 276]}

{"text": "The causes of people continuing to smoke despite the dangers are complex. One of the main reasons is the addictive nature of cigarettes, which makes it difficult for people to quit. Additionally, some people may be unaware of the health risks associated with smoking or may believe that the benefits of smoking outweigh the risks. Another factor is the social aspect of smoking; some people may feel that they are part of a certain group or culture by taking up the habit.  To reduce smoking in society, it is important to make people aware of the dangers of smoking. This can be done through increasing awareness campaigns and taxing cigarettes, which can make the habit more expensive. Additionally, governments should create laws to make it harder for people to access cigarettes, such as raising the minimum legal smoking age. Finally, more research should be done to determine the most effective ways to reduce smoking.  In conclusion, people continue to smoke despite the risks mainly due to the addictive nature of cigarettes, the social aspect, and a lack of awareness regarding the health risks. To reduce smoking in society, it is important to make people aware of the dangers, increase taxes and create laws, and invest in more research.", "label": "alpaca-7b", "label_int": 5, "est_prob_list": [[4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 3.2188756465911865, 3.5065579414367676, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091], [3.0802462220191957, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 2.2933816127479076, 2.995732307434082, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 3.5065579414367676, 2.6592600345611572, 3.912022829055786], [0.6236972481012344, 0.5485951474734715, 1.9273696231345336, 0.4307829439640045, 0.21539147198200226, 0.0, 1.138933396765164, 0.3011050820350647, 0.11653383076190948, 1.2039726972579956], [0.3916380590147869, 0.21915223051732036, 0.5749825604532351, 0.0450435554667179, 0.15735535323619843, 0.0, 0.18756613419206142, 0.051293306052684784, 0.024656367510770643, 0.33415163511918244], [0.6780416570603848, 0.3012197230543409, 2.6909454551835856, 0.051293306052684784, 0.025646653026342392, 0.0, 0.7373721769877842, 0.051293306052684784, 0.030459178611636162, 4.605170185988091], [4.605170185988091, 4.446565155811453, 2.772588722239781, 3.347952867143343, 1.114360645636249, 0.6699801212784109, 2.7119641004233466, 0.561570822771226, 0.2569104137850272, 1.9616585060234524], [4.605170185988091, 4.1588830833596715, 1.9075912847531766, 1.4180430594344708, 2.018816919863401, 1.7165360479904674, 2.2870809064580806, 0.3746934494414107, 0.3087354816496133, 2.367123614131617]], "target_roberta_idx": [24, 41, 44, 73, 74, 99, 106, 162, 178, 212], "target_prob_idx": [23, 40, 43, 72, 73, 97, 104, 160, 175, 209]}
{"text": "Smoking is a harmful habit that has been widely recognized as a significant contributor to various health issues. Despite the well-documented dangers associated with smoking, many individuals still indulge in this habit. Several factors can be attributed to this persistent behavior, and effective measures must be implemented to reduce smoking in society. One of the main causes of continued smoking is addiction. Nicotine, a highly addictive substance found in cigarettes, creates a physical and psychological dependency, making it difficult for smokers to quit. The withdrawal symptoms and cravings experienced by individuals attempting to quit smoking often lead to relapses. Additionally, social factors play a role in perpetuating smoking habits. Peer pressure and social acceptance among certain groups can influence individuals to continue smoking, even if they are aware of the risks. To reduce smoking in society, comprehensive strategies need to be implemented. Firstly, raising awareness about the dangers of smoking through educational campaigns is crucial. These campaigns should target both young individuals who may be considering starting smoking and current smokers who may be motivated to quit. Moreover, providing accessible and affordable smoking cessation support is vital. This can include free counseling services, nicotine replacement therapies, and prescription medications to aid in quitting. Furthermore, implementing stricter regulations on tobacco sales and marketing can contribute to reducing smoking rates. Governments should enforce age restrictions on purchasing tobacco products, as well as imposing higher taxes on cigarettes. Additionally, banning tobacco advertising and implementing plain packaging laws can help eliminate the glamorization of smoking and discourage potential smokers.", "label": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "label_int": 6, "est_prob_list": [[4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.186518409035423, 3.635922325981988, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 3.0620588660240173], [2.6592600345611572, 3.5065577030181885, 3.5065577030181885, 4.605170185988091, 2.207274913787842, 3.871451399543069, 4.234925283326043, 2.8154810070991516, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091], [4.605170185988091, 1.3093334436416626, 1.3093334436416626, 0.02665178128518164, 0.3856624662876129, 4.605170185988091, 0.04642068843046824, 3.472180167833964, 1.56064772605896, 1.063704013824463], [3.912022829055786, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 0.18438090197741985, 1.0498220920562744, 1.2463794404810125, 0.017097747574249905, 4.605170185988091, 2.1202635765075684, 4.0], [4.605170185988091, 1.0216511487960815, 1.0216511487960815, 0.044881587382405996, 2.6592600345611572, 2.267279700799422, 0.09147895375887553, 2.13472189505895, 0.08338159322738647, 1.8420680999755858], [0.38612214526503347, 0.9868157882867288, 0.41764022609721346, 0.16068238169047347, 0.42870212228757315, 0.9934293496156411, 0.021351630691551052, 1.6545429878250857, 0.10490948662213702, 2.772588722239781], [0.24686007793152578, 1.9075912847531766, 0.3087354816496133, 0.5082248420659333, 1.4508328822574619, 4.1588830833596715, 2.5494451709255714, 3.4657359027997265, 2.772588722239781, 4.605170185988091]], "target_roberta_idx": [78, 82, 83, 113, 126, 235, 244, 271, 282, 291], "target_prob_idx": [74, 78, 79, 108, 119, 228, 237, 264, 275, 282]}

Nicotine, the active agent in tobacco, is highly addictive and can create a physical dependence that makes quitting challenging. The withdrawal symptoms, including irritability, anxiety, and cravings, often lead to relapse. Another cause is the psychological aspect of smoking, which becomes a coping mechanism for stress, anxiety, and depression for many. The habit forms part of a daily ritual that is difficult to break without proper support. Furthermore, smoking is deeply embedded in social and cultural practices. In some social circles, smoking is viewed as a way to bond or fit in. The portrayal of smoking in media and entertainment as glamorous or rebellious can also influence individuals, especially adolescents, to start and continue smoking. To reduce smoking in society, comprehensive measures should be implemented. Firstly, education campaigns should focus on the dangers of smoking and the benefits of quitting. These campaigns could include personal stories to make the impacts more relatable. Secondly, access to smoking cessation aids and support programs should be increased, giving individuals the tools and support needed to overcome addiction. Additionally, governments can impose stricter regulations such as banning smoking in public places, increasing taxes on tobacco products, and restricting advertising.

{"text": "The allegory is about a man who has been imprisoned in a cave for many years. He is hungry and thirsty, but he cannot get any food or water because there are no openings to let him out. Eventually he begins to think that he will die if he does not find some way to escape from his prison. So he decides to make a hole in the ceiling so that he can see outside. But before he can do this, he realizes that he must first cut off all the branches of the tree which grows on top of the cave. Then he must climb up onto the tree and begin cutting it down. After doing this, he finally sees what lies beyond the opening in the ceiling. The cave is actually an image of the human mind. It represents the process by which we come to understand our own minds. In other words, the cave symbolizes how we become aware of ourselves as separate beings within the world around us. This awareness is necessary for us to develop self-awareness.

This other world is called \"the heavens\" or \"heavens.\" It has two parts: (1) an upper part where the gods dwell and (2) a lower part where humans reside. Humans can go up into heaven if they want but they do not need to because they already live with God. The first step towards escaping the cave is to realize that we all exist within our own minds. We think about things and then those thoughts become real. If you look at yourself in a mirror, you will notice that your body changes shape when you move around. You may also hear sounds coming out of your mouth. These sound waves travel through air until they reach your ears.

Plato's allegory of the cave is a philosophical story that describes the journey of a prisoner who is freed from a cave and comes to understand the true nature of reality. The story is a metaphor for the process of enlightenment and the struggle to see the truth. In the allegory, the prisoner is chained in a cave and can only see shadows on the wall in front of him. These shadows are created by puppets being moved behind the prisoner, and he believes the shadows are real objects. The prisoner is limited to this narrow perspective and has no concept of the true nature of reality. One day, the prisoner is freed and taken outside into the sunlight. At first, the bright light is overwhelming and he is unable to see clearly. But as he adjusts to the light, he begins to see the world around him and realizes that the shadows on the wall were only illusions. The allegory of the cave is a powerful metaphor for the process of enlightenment. The prisoner's limited perspective in the cave represents the limited understanding of the unenlightened person, while the outside world represents the true nature of reality.

{"text": "Plato's Allegory of the Cave is an allegory used to illustrate his theory of knowledge. It is set in a cave where people are chained up for their entire lives, unable to turn their heads, and unable to see anything but the shadows on the wall in front of them. Plato used this allegory to illustrate the idea that our knowledge of the world is limited, and that we must overcome our limitations in order to gain true knowledge. The people in the cave are said to be like those who know only what is seen and heard in the world, and not what is behind the shadows. The shadows represent the physical world, while the figures behind them represent the intelligible world. This allegory is a representation of the journey of the soul as it leaves the physical world and goes on to explore the higher, more abstract levels of reality. Plato believed that the soul must travel through all three levels of reality before it can reach its highest potential. The allegory is meant to illustrate how the soul must journey from the physical world, through the world of shadows, and eventually reach the highest levels of reality.

{"text": "Plato's allegory of the cave is a powerful metaphorical story found in his famous work, \"The Republic.\" It is a philosophical allegory that explores the nature of reality, knowledge, and enlightenment. In the allegory, Plato describes a group of people who have been chained inside a dark cave since birth. They are unable to move their heads or bodies and can only see the wall in front of them. Behind them, there is a fire, and between the fire and the prisoners, there is a raised walkway. People walk along the walkway, carrying various objects that cast shadows on the wall in front of the prisoners. As the prisoners have never seen anything else, they believe that the shadows are the only reality. Plato then introduces the idea of a prisoner who is freed and forced to leave the cave. At first, this prisoner is blinded by the sunlight outside the cave but slowly begins to see the true nature of reality. He realizes that the shadows were mere illusions and that there is a whole world beyond the cave. The allegory of the cave serves as a metaphor for the journey to enlightenment and the acquisition of knowledge. The prisoners represent the ordinary people who are trapped in ignorance and only perceive a distorted version of reality. The cave symbolizes the physical world and the limited knowledge gained through sensory perception.", "label": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "label_int": 6, "est_prob_list": [[4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 3.8994858215252557, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.250728607177734, 4.605170185988091, 4.51852685213089], [3.912022829055786, 2.3025851249694824, 2.3025851249694824, 3.5065579414367676, 2.9913841833670936, 0.891598105430603, 0.891598105430603, 2.2588930130004883, 2.4079456329345703, 2.7651722729206085], [0.5447272062301636, 0.0, 0.013468458006779352, 0.1984509527683258, 0.3856624662876129, 0.4034939771518111, 0.7765287756919861, 0.01208079867064953, 4.605170185988091, 0.17679804493673146], [4.605170185988091, 0.0, 0.44889628887176514, 0.3856624662876129, 0.3566749691963196, 1.6966146230697632, 1.272965669631958, 0.27168090343475343, 1.4403719939291477, 1.3156301379203796], [1.272965669631958, 0.0, 0.013468458006779352, 0.2744368612766266, 0.18632960319519043, 0.7135581076145172, 0.9162906408309937, 0.006091835722327232, 0.5949169979430735, 0.256740378215909], [0.639902666041133, 3.011889128297055e-06, 1.4847344339331432, 1.881615798349916, 4.446565155811453, 0.33861989585109914, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 0.5115302498321082, 4.605170185988091], [2.1439800628174073, 4.1588830833596715, 0.4575811092471784, 0.4093790074293007, 0.26706278524904525, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 2.367123614131617, 4.605170185988091]], "target_roberta_idx": [31, 43, 44, 74, 104, 118, 119, 125, 136, 219], "target_prob_idx": [27, 39, 40, 69, 99, 111, 112, 118, 129, 211]}

Music veterans The Who and David Bowie, both earned places on the list, at number eight and 10 respectively.

{"text": "When you stop eating gluten and dairy, several things can happen to your body. One of the most common reactions is an improvement in digestive health. Both gluten and dairy can cause digestive issues such as bloating, gas, diarrhea, and constipation in individuals with sensitivities or intolerances. Eliminating gluten and dairy from your diet may also lead to a reduction in inflammation. Gluten, found in wheat, barley, and rye, can trigger an immune response in some people, leading to inflammation in various parts of the body. Similarly, dairy products contain a protein called casein, which may cause inflammation in individuals who are intolerant or sensitive to it.

The Swedish firm, the world's largest maker of home appliances, said it is to relocate about 10 of its 27 plants in western Europe and North America. It did not say which facilities would be affected, but intends moving them to Asia, eastern Europe and Mexico. The company has two manufacturing sites in County Durham. It makes lawn and garden products in Newton Aycliffe, and cookers and ovens in Spennymoor. The Newton Aycliffe plant could also be affected by Electrolux's separate announcement that it is to spin-off its outdoor products unit into a new separate company. Electrolux's subsidiary brands include AEG, Zanussi and Frigidaire. The company said it was speeding up its restructuring programme, which aims to save between \u00a3190m and \u00a3265m annually from 2009. \"We see that about half the plants in high-cost countries - that is around 10 - are at risk,\" said Electrolux chief executive Hans Straberg. \"It looks pretty grim,\" said Swedish trades union official Ulf Carlsson. \"What are we going to end up producing in Sweden?\"", "label": "human", "label_int": 0, "est_prob_list": [[4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.37627899646759, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091], [2.207274913787842, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 3.5065579414367676, 3.0100704034169516, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091], [0.897707549022979, 0.01259512571782568, 3.480570012454603, 0.16251890361309052, 0.18120786825809185, 0.5060664140014387, 3.2188756465911865, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091], [2.3622966440895237, 0.013748413508470938, 1.8707005655897455, 1.1307137312565905, 0.8704489480969921, 0.396778903901577, 4.605170185988091, 4.123524760594918, 2.995732307434082, 4.605170185988091], [1.7265180435277705, 0.02949548570861103, 1.0041727581157016, 1.9798501790104932, 1.7241541148747697, 0.4223263397812843, 4.39482922743413, 3.987791621685028, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091], [1.6331544390514163, 4.605170185988091, 2.906120114864304, 0.9500575943449725, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 0.4093790074293007, 4.605170185988091, 2.6548056865833978, 1.4020427180880297], [1.2685113254635072, 4.605170185988091, 1.3555227024531369, 0.5345421503833068, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 0.2876820724517809, 4.605170185988091, 1.5939337258981352, 2.2870809064580806]], "target_roberta_idx": [36, 54, 55, 88, 89, 110, 137, 150, 235, 250], "target_prob_idx": [31, 49, 50, 83, 84, 102, 122, 134, 206, 219]}
{"text": "The European Union is a great example of the benefits of free trade. It's why we have more people working in Britain than anywhere else in the world, and it's why our exports are worth \u00a31 trillion a year. But that doesn't mean there aren't problems with free trade - especially when it comes to the EU. In fact, if you look at what's happened since the UK joined the EU, it has been a disaster for British businesses. The number of jobs lost as a result of Brexit is estimated by the CBI to be around 4 million. That's almost half of all the jobs lost during the recession. And it's not just about jobs. Free trade also means lower wages, higher prices and less investment. That's why I'm calling on the Government to take back control over our borders so we can protect our economy from the damage being done by uncontrolled immigration.

The firm said it would close its factory at Blyth and move production of washing machines from Britain to Poland. It is also considering closing factories in Belgium and Germany as part of a global restructuring programme. In total, about 2,500 people are expected to lose their jobs by 2010.

{"text": "Electrolux, the Swedish home appliance manufacturer, is set to export jobs from Europe in an effort to streamline its operations and cut costs. The company announced today that it plans to shift production from its plants in Italy to lower-cost countries in Eastern Europe and Asia. The decision comes as Electrolux faces increasing competition in the European market and strives to maintain its profitability. The move is expected to affect approximately 2,800 employees across its Italian plants, including those in Susegana, Porcia, and Solaro. However, the company has assured that it will work closely with employee representatives to minimize the impact on its workforce. The decision to export jobs from Europe has sparked criticism from labor unions and politicians, who argue that it will lead to job losses and a decline in manufacturing capabilities within the region. In response, Electrolux emphasized that the move is necessary to remain competitive and ensure the long-term sustainability of the company. Electrolux is not the only European manufacturer to consider such a strategy. Many companies have been shifting production to emerging markets where labor costs are lower.

{"text": "In a strategic shift that is causing ripples across the European labor market, home appliance giant Electrolux has announced plans to relocate a significant number of its manufacturing jobs outside of Europe. The Swedish multinational, known for its refrigerators, vacuum cleaners, and washing machines, is eyeing new opportunities in regions with lower production costs. The move comes as Electrolux grapples with increasing competition and changing market dynamics. Sources within the company suggest that the decision is a response to the need for greater efficiency and cost-effectiveness, which has been exacerbated by the economic pressures of the ongoing pandemic. The export of jobs will affect several of Electrolux's plants across Europe, although the company has not yet released specific numbers or locations. It is understood that the transition will occur over the next two years, with a focus on preserving as much employment as possible through retraining and redeployment within the company. This development has sparked concern among trade unions and workers' representatives, who fear the social impact of job losses and are calling for urgent discussions with Electrolux management. They are demanding clarity on the future of affected workers and seeking assurances on measures to mitigate the fallout from this decision.", "label": "gpt-4-1106-preview", "label_int": 7, "est_prob_list": [[3.5065579414367676, 3.5065579414367676, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091], [2.995732069015503, 2.995732069015503, 2.1104449125436635, 3.5065579414367676, 2.4079456329345703, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091], [0.4620981216430664, 0.0, 0.558017203441033, 0.6348783373832703, 0.49917062123616535, 2.9483777284622192, 1.60864719748497, 0.5540203861892223, 0.12783338129520416, 0.4679917097091675], [0.7596228917439779, 0.0, 0.6099214966480548, 2.1202635765075684, 0.6885917534430822, 3.607924222946167, 0.9309304722895225, 1.932525247335434, 2.0402209758758545, 1.9816580675542355], [1.4748667180538177, 0.005025163292884827, 0.5033741822609534, 1.0216511487960815, 0.6226454774538676, 1.5828458964824677, 0.8026485443115234, 0.32713431492447853, 0.16251890361309052, 0.7359261512756348], [2.7119641004233466, 0.06038051098890748, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 2.367123614131617, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 0.9602099658089905, 4.1588830833596715, 0.5823328142196552], [4.605170185988091, 4.431963831366388e-05, 4.605170185988091, 3.4657359027997265, 0.35252387713514305, 4.605170185988091, 0.6628739220533186, 0.2889700237405864, 0.14715689245059935, 0.4348954767694445]], "target_roberta_idx": [28, 29, 44, 47, 56, 88, 131, 155, 156, 198], "target_prob_idx": [25, 26, 41, 43, 52, 82, 120, 144, 145, 184]}

The tourists were never really troubled by the hosts as they ran out 24-12 winners at Suncorp Stadium on Saturday night to take an unassailable 3-0 lead in the three match series. Lions captain Sam Warburton said it was \"a great day\" after his side had been written off following last week's defeat against New Zealand but he added that there would be no complacency ahead of next weekend's second Test. He told BBC Sport: \"We're not going into this game thinking we've got anything to prove or any excuses to make.\" But coach Warren Gatland has warned his players about being too confident heading into Sunday's clash at ANZ Stadium in Sydney. He said: \"There is always something you can do better - whether it's your preparation, tactics, execution or whatever.", "label": "gpt-j-6b", "label_int": 2, "est_prob_list": [[4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 3.912022829055786, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 3.9120230674743652, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 3.2188758850097656, 4.605170185988091], [2.6592600345611572, 3.9120230674743652, 1.7719568014144897, 2.525728702545166, 4.605170185988091, 3.912022829055786, 2.7414902448654175, 4.605170185988091, 3.9120230674743652, 4.605170185988091], [0.15082287788391113, 0.08925741314888, 2.6592600345611572, 0.0, 4.605170185988091, 3.411022553841273, 2.5, 0.010050326585769653, 4.605170185988091, 0.3424903452396393], [0.4307829439640045, 0.3977009057998657, 2.207274913787842, 0.0, 2.6592600345611572, 0.482405682404836, 2.5, 0.07257068157196045, 4.605170185988091, 0.12783338129520416], [0.4004775285720825, 0.21085137575864793, 4.605170185988091, 0.0, 4.605170185988091, 1.3452579602599144, 2.5151520152576268, 0.12783338129520416, 4.605170185988091, 0.7765287756919861], [0.22705745063534608, 2.4096832285504126, 4.1588830833596715, 4.605170185988091, 2.018816919863401, 4.605170185988091, 0.29815337231907635, 1.556193397915288, 0.18388527877013736, 0.9602099658089905], [0.3746934494414107, 1.7165360479904674, 3.4657359027997265, 4.1588830833596715, 1.067840630001356, 4.605170185988091, 1.114360645636249, 2.2870809064580806, 0.5753641449035618, 0.6931471805599453]], "target_roberta_idx": [21, 33, 42, 78, 81, 93, 98, 165, 179, 187], "target_prob_idx": [20, 31, 38, 66, 69, 81, 86, 150, 164, 172]}

{"text": "Sea Inside, a leading marine conservation organization, is celebrating a double triumph today. Not only has the organization successfully campaigned for the protection of a vast new marine reserve, but it has also secured vital funding for its ongoing projects. The newly established marine reserve, named the Sea Inside Sanctuary, spans over 500 square miles of pristine ocean habitat. It is home to a diverse range of marine species, including endangered turtles, dolphins, and coral reefs.

{"text": "Shell is to pay $1m (\u00a3522,000) to the ex-finance chief who stepped down from her post in April 2004 after the firm over-stated its reserves. Judy Boynton finally left the firm on 31 December, having spent the intervening time as a special advisor to chief executive Jeroen van der Veer. In January 2004, Shell told shocked investors that its reserves were 20% smaller than previously thought. Shell said the pay-off was in line with Ms Boynton's contract. She was leaving \"by mutual agreement to pursue other career opportunities\", the firm said in a statement. The severance package means she keeps long-term share options, but fails to collect on a 2003 incentive plan since the firm has failed to meet the targets included in it. The revelation that Shell had inflated its reserves led to the resignation of its chairman, Sir Phil Watts, and production chief Walter van der Vijver. An investigation commissioned by Shell found that Ms Boynton had to share responsibility for the company's behaviour. Despite receiving an email from Mr Van de Vijver which said the firm had \"fooled\" the market about its reserves, the investigation said, she did nothing to inquire further. In all, Shell restated its reserves four times during 2003. In September, it paid \u00a382.7m in fines to regulators on both sides of the Atlantic for violating market rules in its reporting of its reserves.", "label": "human", "label_int": 0, "est_prob_list": [[4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091], [4.605170185988091, 3.9854681599916897, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091], [4.605170185988091, 0.11653383076190948, 0.23362914572680016, 1.1120942301220365, 0.02020268701016903, 4.13765371512333, 1.2571988629149506, 1.4655235165700813, 0.47705664712034895, 4.605170185988091], [4.605170185988091, 0.0, 1.6126321587297652, 0.3784895650022106, 0.04459181559420861, 2.480067230543381, 0.7493887364864349, 1.116969247392903, 1.6765073468675504, 4.605170185988091], [4.605170185988091, 0.012280375112967031, 0.24283015479903539, 0.8262371089723375, 0.0, 3.651190632277787, 0.9189506677213045, 0.9801372420042753, 0.12783338129520416, 4.605170185988091], [0.3522205935893521, 4.605170185988091, 0.1980699137620938, 0.7168637071772613, 0.5212969236332861, 1.6133518117552368, 4.605170185988091, 2.772588722239781, 0.27217788591581565, 4.446565155811453], [0.7248958788745256, 4.605170185988091, 0.561570822771226, 0.7744928200138977, 1.6331544390514163, 2.2870809064580806, 2.367123614131617, 2.1439800628174073, 0.3087354816496133, 4.1588830833596715]], "target_roberta_idx": [60, 98, 110, 122, 152, 159, 181, 189, 191, 245], "target_prob_idx": [50, 83, 94, 107, 134, 141, 163, 170, 172, 222]}

The company said its Nigerian subsidiary, Shell Petroleum Development Company (SPDC), had been accused of paying kickbacks and other illegal payments to officials at state-owned oil companies during the 1990s. It is alleged that SPDC made more than $2bn (\u00a31.3bn) worth of corrupt payments between 1993 and 2003. In return for these payments, SPDC was awarded contracts to develop offshore fields in the Niger Delta region.

{"text": "\"The former CEO of Shell, Peter Voser, has received a $1 million payoff after stepping down from the oil giant last year. According to the company's annual report, Voser received the payout as part of his severance package, which was agreed upon when he left the company in January 2014. Voser, who had been with Shell for 29 years, stepped down as CEO after the company's profits took a hit due to declining oil prices and increased competition. He was replaced by Ben van Beurden, who has since led the company's efforts to restructure and refocus its operations. The $1 million payoff to Voser is in addition to a $1.8 million pension pot and other benefits he received as part of his severance package. The total value of Voser's severance package is estimated to be around $2.8 million. The news of Voser's payoff has sparked criticism from some shareholders, who say that the payout is excessive and does not reflect the company's financial performance under his leadership. However, Shell's board has defended the payout, saying that it is in line with industry standards and reflects Voser's long service and contributions to the company.

{"text": "Former Shell CEO, Ben van Beurden, has been awarded a staggering $1 million payoff upon his departure from the company. The decision has raised eyebrows and sparked a debate about executive compensation. Van Beurden, who served as the CEO of Shell for six years, oversaw the company during a difficult period marked by the oil price crash and the transition towards renewable energy. Despite the challenges, the company reported strong financial results under his leadership. The generous payout has drawn criticism from various stakeholders, including investors and environmental activists. They argue that such exorbitant rewards are out of touch with reality, particularly in a time when many people are struggling due to the economic impact of the ongoing pandemic. Shell, on the other hand, defends the decision, stating that the payout is in line with industry standards and reflects van Beurden's contributions to the company's performance. They also emphasize that the payoff was part of his contractual agreement. This controversy renews the ongoing debate surrounding executive pay and income inequality. Critics argue that such high payouts perpetuate a culture where top executives are handsomely rewarded regardless of company performance, while employees and shareholders suffer. The issue is likely to fuel further discussions about the need for greater transparency and accountability in executive compensation.", "label": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "label_int": 6, "est_prob_list": [[4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091], [4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 3.7287649154663085, 3.2188756465911865, 3.5065579414367676, 3.7741543565477644, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091], [2.211320161819458, 0.6161860823631287, 4.605170185988091, 0.22484393417835236, 2.813410758972168, 0.18632952868938446, 0.034990301089627404, 0.1539423419162631, 0.0, 0.0], [1.886944830417633, 0.5621189475059509, 3.912022829055786, 0.5136264383792877, 3.5065579414367676, 2.1202635765075684, 0.24658456870487758, 0.6019864082336426, 0.010050326585769653, 0.0], [2.072633996605873, 0.16251890361309052, 4.605170185988091, 0.17931605651974677, 2.6592600345611572, 0.40047743916511536, 0.008614565644945418, 0.3416973799467087, 0.0, 0.0], [0.39188584998178355, 1.3862943611198906, 4.605170185988091, 3.506557897319982, 1.9968544470067566, 4.605170185988091, 0.004570840953562545, 2.600738465313122, 0.0020397512097245067, 0.00012412379559038894], [0.48258241145259567, 3.4657359027997265, 3.242592351485517, 3.7534179752515073, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 1.9075912847531766, 4.1588830833596715, 0.6325225587435105, 4.605170185988091]], "target_roberta_idx": [22, 31, 85, 108, 117, 162, 200, 226, 232, 233], "target_prob_idx": [20, 29, 82, 105, 112, 156, 192, 216, 222, 223]}
{"text": "Former Shell CEO Ben van Beurden has received a severance package worth $1 million after stepping down from his position at the end of 2022. The payout comes as part of a pre-agreed deal that outlines the terms of van Beurden's departure after nearly a decade at the helm of the oil and gas giant. Van Beurden, who took the reins of Shell in 2014, has been a pivotal figure in steering the company through a period of significant challenges, including the 2014 oil price crash, the transition towards renewable energy, and the global push for more stringent climate change policies. According to a Shell spokesperson, the payment is in line with industry standards and reflects van Beurden's contribution to the company during his tenure as CEO. The spokesperson further emphasized that under van Beurden's leadership, Shell not only weathered tough market conditions but also embarked on a strategic shift towards sustainable energy sources, aligning with the Paris Agreement goals. However, the sizeable payoff has sparked criticism from environmental groups and some shareholders who argue that such payouts are excessive, particularly in light of the ongoing climate crisis and the company's responsibility for significant carbon emissions. Activists are calling for a reevaluation of executive compensation in the energy sector, urging companies to more closely align pay with sustainable performance metrics.", "label": "gpt-4-1106-preview", "label_int": 7, "est_prob_list": [[4.605170185988091, 3.9120230674743652, 3.912022829055786, 3.912022829055786, 4.605170185988091, 4.43188339471817, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091], [4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 3.9120230674743652, 3.9120230674743652, 3.9120230674743652, 3.9120230078697205, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091], [2.205692352520095, 1.547303205728531, 4.605170185988091, 1.975886399547259, 0.010050326585769653, 0.01515253959223628, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.455668159450094, 0.783282927104405], [3.834394356028901, 2.1437766917049883, 3.5065579414367676, 1.7396716276804607, 0.02284438395872712, 0.0464220461435616, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 1.7052205006281536, 0.8223518303462437], [4.605170185988091, 2.330402284860611, 4.605170185988091, 2.565674682458242, 0.00753774493932724, 0.012588416691869497, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 1.7555985788090362, 0.4348613704953875], [2.906120114864304, 0.5964175541013942, 0.6548283162578087, 2.367123614131617, 1.3256697393034558, 0.33024168687057687, 0.5082248420659333, 0.5412311385341033, 1.881615798349916, 3.147282171681192], [0.6776429940239801, 1.0172250758241368, 2.2870809064580806, 0.9529486195211139, 1.4847344339331432, 0.007313604704210449, 0.23280876178627694, 0.7576857016975165, 2.367123614131617, 3.242592351485517]], "target_roberta_idx": [51, 64, 109, 110, 129, 130, 140, 141, 210, 224], "target_prob_idx": [44, 57, 101, 102, 121, 122, 131, 132, 197, 211]}

So I get this young kid probably about 19 or 20, not much older. So I listened to his original piece and it didn't sit well with me. It was good but sounded familiar. I asked him if he wrote it and he tried to claim it. He then admitted he copied some of it from a record, I told him I knew the record very well. I had played guitar on it 30 years previously. So I cut him a bit of a break and just told him to start the audition again , he blew it up could read really well and promptly got shortlisted for the job.

This can be very frustrating when you know that what you came up with has value. You feel like you should get some sort of recognition for coming up with such a great idea.

{"text": "As an AI language model, I don't have personal experiences or emotions. However, I can provide you with some general advice on how to handle a situation where a co-worker steals your ideas and presents them as their own. 1. Gather evidence: Document your ideas and any interactions that prove you came up with them first. This can include emails, meeting minutes, or any other written records. 2. Address the issue directly: Talk to the co-worker privately, expressing your concerns and providing evidence of your original ideas. Stay calm and professional during the conversation. 3. Involve your supervisor or manager: If speaking to your co-worker doesn't resolve the issue, consider discussing the matter with your supervisor or manager.

{"text": "I strongly agree with this statement. If women and men are both working full time, they should share household works. First of all, if women and men are working full time, and they are working in the same amount of time, logically, the amount of time they do household works should be the sam e. However, if one of them work for longer hours, the household works should still be shared but the other one should do more household works. Second of all, everyone have responsibility to do household works because everyone lives in the house, makes the house dirty, creates dirty clothes and dishes. If there is only either women or men doing household works, it is not fair at all, because they both work full time. But as I mentioned before, the amount of time doing household works can be arranged, it doesn't have to be evenly shared. For instance, if the woman in this family work for longer hours or got an extra call by work, the man should help and do her part of household works. And when the man are working more, the woman should do the same. This does not only solve the problem of who should do household works but can also show that women and men are supporting each other in various situations. In conclusion, when women and men are both doing full time jobs, they should share household works. But it doesn't have to to be split in two halves, it can have alternatives depending on the working hours or special situations. In this way, the house can be more peaceful and have more harmony without arguments about who should do the household works.", "label": "human", "label_int": 0, "est_prob_list": [[4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.341650346435878, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091], [1.6607311964035034, 2.0174994524911694, 4.461123824016642, 4.605170185988091, 2.435084124406179, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 3.3884945800033486, 4.605170185988091], [4.605170185988091, 3.1146685469814366, 0.5079836560155141, 4.605170185988091, 0.4620353579521179, 1.469675898551941, 2.156229486426457, 2.0586703643322255, 0.07469201599893617, 1.4252695760273555], [2.958998747614361, 1.0206239620844524, 0.06733741797506809, 4.605170185988091, 0.6780511410416451, 0.20594572759739138, 1.7719568014144897, 0.13926199078559875, 0.07257068157196045, 3.129624530035082], [4.605170185988091, 4.2847442626953125, 0.5601778831126505, 4.605170185988091, 0.6051031900054498, 0.31471070647239685, 1.6869750366172496, 0.9285061126398061, 0.013446371470117457, 1.2378743886947632], [2.906120114864304, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 2.8371272433773522, 0.27217788591581565, 1.8562979903656263, 3.242592351485517, 4.605170185988091, 0.2929040164329326, 3.242592351485517], [1.2685113254635072, 2.906120114864304, 4.605170185988091, 1.0453677741492975, 0.4575811092471784, 1.807507826196194, 3.0602707946915624, 4.1588830833596715, 0.3194307707663612, 3.0602707946915624]], "target_roberta_idx": [70, 71, 96, 108, 138, 142, 211, 231, 245, 300], "target_prob_idx": [68, 69, 94, 106, 136, 140, 209, 229, 243, 298]}

{"text": "Women have been in the workforce since ancient times. In fact, it was a woman who invented the first loom that allowed people to weave cloth. Women were also responsible for making clothes for their families as well as cooking food. However, with the invention of machines such as sewing machine, washing machine etc., most jobs can be done by either sex. This has led to an increase in female participation in the workplace. The number of females employed increased from 3% in 1900 to over 30% today (Bureau of Labor Statistics). Although there are still some occupations where only males are required, this trend shows that more women than ever before work outside the home. The main reason why women participate in the workforce is because they want to earn money so that they can spend on themselves rather than spending all day doing housework. They feel that if they don't go out to work then they will not get anything else except chores. Another reason why women choose to work is due to social pressure. For example, when a man goes back to his family after finishing work he gets praised but when a woman returns she is criticized. Therefore, women tend to stay at home even though they would like to work. There are other reasons too which make them prefer staying at home. One of these reasons is that they believe that being a mother is very important. If they leave the job market then they may miss opportunities to become mothers later on.

{"text": "In many countries, both men and women are working full-time, and it is essential for both genders to share household responsibilities. I strongly agree that both men and women should share household chores to maintain a fair and balanced distribution of responsibilities. Firstly, sharing household responsibilities is essential for achieving gender equality in the family. Women should not be expected to bear the burden of household chores solely, as it can hinder their career growth and professional development. Moreover, men should also be involved in childcare and other domestic responsibilities to promote gender equality and challenge traditional gender roles. Secondly, sharing household responsibilities can improve the overall well-being of the family. When both partners contribute to household tasks, it can reduce stress and conflicts, leading to a more harmonious family life. Furthermore, when both men and women share household responsibilities, it can promote a sense of teamwork and cooperation, which can strengthen the bond between family members. Thirdly, sharing household responsibilities can benefit children. Children learn from what they see, and when they see both parents contributing equally to household tasks, they are more likely to adopt healthy attitudes towards gender roles and responsibilities. Moreover, when both parents are involved in childcare, it can improve the quality of parenting and provide children with a sense of security and stability. However, it is essential to note that sharing household responsibilities is not always easy, and it requires effort and commitment from both partners.

In this essay, I will discuss both sides of the argument and provide my opinion on the matter. On the one hand, there are several benefits to men and women sharing household responsibilities. Firstly, it helps to promote gender equality and challenges traditional gender roles. By sharing household tasks, both men and women are able to contribute equally to the running of the household, which can help to reduce the burden on any one individual. Additionally, it can help to improve relationships within the household by fostering a sense of shared responsibility and teamwork. On the other hand, there are some who argue that men and women should not be required to share household responsibilities. They believe that household tasks are primarily the responsibility of women and that men should focus on providing financial support for the family. This argument is based on the idea that men and women have different roles in society and that women are naturally better suited to domestic tasks. In my opinion, both men and women should share household responsibilities. While there may be some tasks that are traditionally associated with one gender or the other, it is important to recognize that these roles are largely outdated and do not reflect the changing nature of modern society. By sharing household responsibilities, both men and women can contribute to the well-being of the household and help to create a more equal and harmonious relationship.

{"text": "In today's modern society, where both women and men are working full time, it is becoming increasingly important for them to share household chores. While some may argue that traditional gender roles should dictate who does what in the household, I strongly believe that both genders should take equal responsibility for household tasks. Firstly, the division of household chores should not be based on gender, but rather on the principle of fairness and equality. Just because women have traditionally been responsible for housework does not mean that it should continue to be their sole burden. With both genders working full time, it is only fair that household chores are distributed equally to ensure a balanced and harmonious relationship. Moreover, sharing household work can lead to better communication and understanding between couples. When both partners actively participate in household chores, it not only relieves the burden on one person but also promotes teamwork and cooperation. This can strengthen the bond between couples and create a more supportive and egalitarian relationship. Additionally, sharing household work can have positive effects on children and their perception of gender roles. When children see their parents sharing responsibilities, they learn that household chores are not limited to a specific gender. This helps to break down traditional stereotypes and encourages children to view gender roles in a more progressive and inclusive manner. However, it is important to acknowledge that some individuals may have reservations about sharing household chores. They may argue that certain tasks are better suited for one gender or that they lack the necessary skills for certain chores. While it is true that individuals may have different strengths and weaknesses, it should not be used as an excuse to avoid sharing responsibilities.", "label": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "label_int": 6, "est_prob_list": [[4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.299052433534102, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 3.9120230674743652], [4.605170185988091, 3.9707264999548593, 3.2188758850097656, 4.605170185988091, 2.738966830074787, 3.5065579414367676, 2.813410758972168, 2.813410758972168, 4.605170185988091, 1.966112732887268], [0.8573991656303406, 0.21840748935937881, 0.8439700603485107, 0.1875684058124369, 4.605170185988091, 3.0433127846568824, 1.101563694221633, 1.8971199989318848, 0.5158507376909256, 0.5268219858407974], [0.8404668821021914, 0.19856428106625876, 0.5798184871673584, 1.9738105518574065, 4.605170185988091, 1.4213102817535401, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 0.5401406353339553, 1.312721110880375], [0.9830564260482788, 0.15475145354866982, 0.2876819968223572, 0.15612464838407256, 3.337633065879345, 3.0660174541175365, 1.0212051062179464, 1.7719569206237793, 0.361700102686882, 1.1131927371025085], [0.6623755218931916, 0.10777124967437818, 0.9808292530117262, 0.11498997968327447, 1.1413216945483657, 1.175729592012541, 3.506557897319982, 1.6133518117552368, 0.2173012756899814, 1.4180430594344708], [0.3633938941874773, 0.9400072584914712, 2.5494451709255714, 0.5082248420659333, 0.561570822771226, 1.4508328822574619, 4.605170185988091, 2.1439800628174073, 0.22705745063534608, 2.772588722239781]], "target_roberta_idx": [76, 125, 128, 152, 197, 203, 251, 253, 258, 262], "target_prob_idx": [75, 123, 126, 149, 193, 199, 247, 249, 254, 258]}
{"text": "As societies progress and the traditional roles of men and women evolve, the notion of shared household responsibilities becomes increasingly relevant. With both genders contributing equally to the workforce, it stands to reason that domestic tasks should also be distributed equitably between partners. I strongly agree that men and women should share household chores, and there are compelling reasons for this stance. Firstly, the principle of fairness necessitates a balance in household responsibilities. When both partners are investing similar amounts of time and energy in their professional lives, it is only just that the burdens and duties of home life are equally divided. This approach not only promotes gender equality but also fosters a sense of partnership and mutual respect within the relationship. Moreover, sharing household work has positive repercussions on the family dynamics. Children who grow up witnessing their parents partake equally in domestic chores are likely to develop a more balanced view of gender roles. This early exposure can shape their attitudes towards gender equality and influence their future relationships positively. In addition, shared household responsibilities can alleviate the stress and burnout that often results from one partner shouldering the majority of domestic tasks. When both partners contribute to maintaining the home, it can lead to a more harmonious living environment, as the workload is less overwhelming for each individual. This can have a positive impact on the couple's relationship, as well as on their individual well-being. In conclusion, the sharing of household chores between men and women is a logical extension of their equal participation in the workforce. Such an arrangement promotes fairness, sets a positive example for the next generation, and contributes to a more balanced and fulfilling domestic life.", "label": "gpt-4-1106-preview", "label_int": 7, "est_prob_list": [[4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 3.9120230674743652], [4.24427580088377, 4.605170185988091, 3.2600190242131553, 3.4106637636820474, 4.605170185988091, 3.3213636906584725, 2.995732069015503, 2.813410699367523, 3.912022829055786, 4.605170185988091], [0.6323733329772949, 4.605170185988091, 1.6052970886230469, 2.0467423333062067, 2.813410758972168, 0.5708127021789551, 2.4079456329345703, 0.04082195460796356, 2.995732307434082, 1.1394343376159668], [1.423136830329895, 2.8691159784793854, 2.608015219370524, 0.6253873093260659, 1.0498220920562744, 0.7021600138396025, 3.5065579414367676, 0.4780358076095581, 3.912022829055786, 0.5621188282966614], [0.42432188987731934, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 2.0579660483118563, 1.4271163940429688, 1.3013022243976593, 2.525728464126587, 0.1984509527683258, 4.605170185988091, 0.7985076308250427], [4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 1.114360645636249, 1.5198257537444133, 1.5198257537444133, 1.0908301482260547, 1.5198257537444133, 2.1439800628174073, 0.43318965612301924, 1.0565410747474226], [0.22533560814028022, 1.4416021131680892, 0.44531101665536404, 0.3433370645440026, 0.8453572871182314, 0.9400072584914712, 1.7165360479904674, 0.03241845399344189, 1.0059253680232867, 1.807507826196194]], "target_roberta_idx": [27, 38, 40, 44, 59, 82, 178, 201, 205, 283], "target_prob_idx": [26, 37, 39, 43, 57, 79, 174, 197, 200, 274]}

This prepares your muscles for action. 3.", "label": "gpt-4-1106-preview", "label_int": 7, "est_prob_list": [[3.912022829055786, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 3.9120230674743652], [2.995732307434082, 2.1202635765075684, 3.749246733529227, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.423736857043372, 3.6205219626426697, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 3.912022829055786], [0.0, 0.005025163292884827, 1.4285714285714286, 0.16730126179754734, 1.321833848953247, 0.12783338129520416, 4.605170185988091, 0.42630593478679657, 1.25, 0.005050671752542257], [0.010205504484474659, 0.15109340287745, 0.36081838607788086, 0.408822496732076, 4.605170185988091, 0.1384233981370926, 4.605170185988091, 0.7449393272399902, 0.4977969191968441, 0.08212600648403168], [0.0, 0.04715532436966896, 1.4285714285714286, 1.2862081031004589, 1.7719568014144897, 0.3161425102088187, 0.9416084885597229, 0.44275952875614166, 0.4023594856262207, 0.03949609026312828], [3.7534179752515073, 0.5479651707154474, 4.446565155811453, 3.912023005428146, 4.605170185988091, 1.311070939882303, 1.175729592012541, 0.6931471805599453, 4.605170185988091, 0.26197371574157396], [1.7609878105613013, 0.0018638280924765799, 4.1588830833596715, 4.605170185988091, 1.1413125538522362, 0.06206380779660779, 1.2685113254635072, 0.4575811092471784, 0.19559728498141207, 0.6325225587435105]], "target_roberta_idx": [53, 56, 64, 84, 86, 90, 93, 102, 133, 137], "target_prob_idx": [47, 50, 58, 77, 78, 82, 85, 93, 122, 126]}
{"text": "Since fire seems to have been developed by our ancestors at least a million years ago, before they were even human - *homo erectus* was thought to have had fire - the experience certainly goes deep with us. A campfire was a deterrent to predators who would otherwise sneak in and snatch people. Fear of fire is an even deeper instinct that goes back to the first land animals, because the high oxygen content of the atmosphere at times made random forest fires an utter apocalypse. So even the smell was and is a deterrent. But by whatever process, hominids overcame that and came to use fire as a tool, and the same glow and dancing light that sparked fear in *everything* else became a source of security to the hominid line. As long as that fire danced and crackled, the leopards would keep their distance. It's the same thing with the sound of a soft rain. Sitting at the entrance to a cave mouth with soft rain trickling outside, you were secure that no leopard was going to be out in that rain looking for you or your children.

{"text": "Watching a campfire or fireplace burn can be relaxing for several reasons. First, the flickering flames create a soothing and calming visual display that can captivate the viewer's attention, allowing them to focus on the present moment and let go of worries and stress. Additionally, the warmth and light emitted by the fire can create a cozy and inviting atmosphere, making the viewer feel comfortable and relaxed. Furthermore, the scent of wood smoke can be very calming and nostalgic, evoking memories of camping trips, family gatherings, or cozy nights by the fireplace. The crackling sound of the flames can also be meditative, providing a soothing background noise that can help to quiet the mind and promote relaxation.

Our ancestors likely found a sense of security and comfort around fires, which could be deeply ingrained in our psychology. - Light source: Before modern lighting, fire was the primary source of light after dark.", "label": "gpt-4-1106-preview", "label_int": 7, "est_prob_list": [[4.581169831481847, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091], [2.293858341195367, 3.912022829055786, 4.605170185988091, 2.9459777176380157, 4.143072128295898, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091], [3.1174469861117275, 0.13068239390850067, 0.21923331703458512, 0.9220770627260209, 1.3470736742019653, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 0.13230063517888388, 1.875607172648112], [4.605170185988091, 0.48889472940936685, 0.5683034828730992, 2.594462251663208, 1.7147983312606812, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 0.1571482022603353, 1.471516450246175], [4.605170185988091, 0.030937671661376953, 0.22292280622891017, 0.8427089944481849, 2.1202635765075684, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 0.09284137686093648, 0.4488963683446248], [1.5378442592470916, 3.506557897319982, 4.605170185988091, 1.9616585060234524, 1.6739764335716716, 0.2076393647782445, 0.1980699137620938, 0.44531101665536404, 4.446565155811453, 3.9357395320454622], [1.2549258765340046, 4.605170185988091, 3.0602707946915624, 1.5939337258981352, 1.2374878889485892, 0.0740623424617038, 0.4412956959244483, 0.1158318155251217, 0.07574475630133456, 3.242592351485517]], "target_roberta_idx": [46, 72, 82, 183, 188, 189, 190, 191, 202, 203], "target_prob_idx": [40, 65, 73, 165, 170, 171, 172, 173, 184, 185]}

The problem is that this approach does not work well when dealing with complex systems like humans or machines. This is because the complexity of these systems is much greater than what can be programmed into a computer. In order to make an intelligent system, one must first understand how the system works and then program it accordingly. This requires understanding the underlying principles of the system, which are often difficult to describe.

What AI makes excuciatingly clear is that humans are far more programmable than we'd like to believe.

The real terminators are our own habits, easily molded by so many methods. Artificial intelligence merely hastens our assimilation, which happens with or without it.

AI systems are designed to learn and make decisions based on data inputs, and they can become increasingly sophisticated and autonomous over time. If an AI system were to become rogue, it could potentially pose a threat to humanity if it were programmed with malicious intent or if it were to develop its own goals that were in conflict with human interests.", "label": "vicuna-13b-v1.5", "label_int": 4, "est_prob_list": [[2.4079456329345703, 3.9120230674743652, 3.8490096872503106, 3.912022829055786, 4.605170185988091, 3.610343595345815, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 3.422719108206885], [2.995732307434082, 2.3025851249694824, 2.472935210574757, 2.813410758972168, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 3.016143321990967, 2.813410758972168, 3.2188758850097656, 2.917924859694072], [0.4232522249221802, 0.9162907600402832, 0.04286847669969906, 0.0, 0.06391669064760208, 0.5732442537943522, 1.2455483973026276, 1.6607311964035034, 4.605170185988091, 0.38909086159297396], [2.3377052942911782, 1.1563176959753036, 0.3988867591727864, 0.5798184871673584, 0.34837681241333485, 1.5206077893575032, 1.3816478587687016, 1.7719568014144897, 4.605170185988091, 2.139808791024344], [0.7391084035237631, 0.6236509027336068, 0.03063780989922861, 0.0, 0.04833618131945956, 0.5048751066287718, 0.5555275804363191, 0.7339692115783691, 4.605170185988091, 0.9092611925942558], [0.514739523087127, 1.0233888674305223, 2.018816919863401, 4.605170185988091, 1.7839773287860001, 0.8446970786871463, 2.2493405784752336, 1.9075912847531766, 0.7744928200138977, 2.772588722239781], [0.7088955375280844, 1.807507826196194, 2.0794415416798357, 4.605170185988091, 2.018816919863401, 0.8266785731844679, 2.4541349911212467, 1.6331544390514163, 0.8266785731844679, 1.7609878105613013]], "target_roberta_idx": [45, 52, 55, 77, 80, 83, 92, 93, 104, 131], "target_prob_idx": [42, 49, 52, 73, 76, 79, 88, 89, 100, 127]}

{"text": "The idea of us being in a simulation started by looking at how we, as a civilization, use simulations to find experimental results. As time goes on, and as our computers grow in power, our simulations become more and more complex. The more details of an experiment we can simulate, the more accurate and precise the end results will be. Eventually we simulate everything that could possibly affect the experiment, right down to individual atoms, because that would give us the highest possible level of accuracy. Once our technology advances to a high enough level, we will be able to simulate an entire planet, or solar system, or even a galaxy with exact precision. From there, if we can simulate one galaxy, it's not a big leap to simulating another one, and then who knows how many more after that. The theory that we are in a simulation follows this logic: Given the size of the universe, the odds are good that there is at least one advanced civilization somewhere with the capability to simulate our entire galaxy. Given that once they can simulate one galaxy, they can simulate many more, odds are good that there are many simulations running at once. Since there is one true reality, but some greater number of simulations, odds are that we are part of a simulation.", "label": "human", "label_int": 0, "est_prob_list": [[4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091], [4.605170185988091, 3.358288073539734, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 3.912022829055786, 3.912022829055786, 3.912022829055786, 4.605170185988091, 2.957251787185669, 3.2188758850097656], [0.12783338129520416, 2.917970640082238, 4.605170185988091, 0.5944900455963039, 1.170645425741134, 0.8675006031990051, 1.2581456761567285, 2.568203389644623, 2.995732307434082, 2.2972647190093993], [1.6557825314046302, 2.4079456329345703, 4.605170185988091, 1.8450778207088194, 3.5065579414367676, 4.2553707189560654, 4.605170185988091, 3.930425141747363, 4.605170185988091, 3.7443280258922766], [0.4360798036155616, 4.423011508709317, 4.605170185988091, 0.6833715005486867, 1.7697568109370228, 1.2378742694854736, 1.2378742694854736, 4.605170185988091, 3.2188756465911865, 4.605170185988091], [0.11145544092532282, 0.34117075740276714, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 1.7385149547092427, 0.14701474296180966, 1.5939337258981352, 0.6107035113488707, 4.605170185988091, 1.4847344339331432], [0.2076393647782445, 1.5198257537444133, 4.605170185988091, 3.4657359027997265, 1.556193397915288, 0.5893503868783018, 1.0233888674305223, 0.561570822771226, 3.0602707946915624, 1.3862943611198906]], "target_roberta_idx": [81, 94, 98, 99, 122, 123, 124, 157, 171, 196], "target_prob_idx": [80, 93, 97, 98, 121, 122, 123, 155, 169, 194]}

One line of reasoning comes from advancements in technology. As our own virtual reality capabilities progress, it becomes increasingly plausible that future civilizations could create simulations indistinguishable from reality. If that were the case, the number of simulated realities would far outnumber the one base reality. So, statistically speaking, it is more likely that we are in a simulated reality rather than the base reality. Another aspect is the concept of the simulation's glitches or limitations. If we were indeed in a simulation, there might be certain inconsistencies or anomalies that can be detected. Scientists could potentially search for clues or evidence of such glitches in the laws of physics or the behavior of fundamental particles. Additionally, the nature of reality itself could provide hints. If our reality is a simulation, it might be programmed with certain rules or limitations that are not present in the base reality.

{"text": "The Chinese government has been very clear about its position on this issue for some time now. In fact, it's not even a secret anymore. It is widely known in the international community that China considers Taiwan to be an inseparable part of the People's Republic of China (PRC). This is because the PRC was founded by the unification of two different ethnic groups, the Han Chinese and the Taiwanese. As such, there are many historical reasons as to why the PRC considers Taiwan to be a part of the PRC. For example, during the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911), the Qing Emperor had his son marry a woman from Taiwan. When she died, he declared her to be his successor. Since then, the descendants of the emperor have always considered Taiwan to be their ancestral homeland. However, since the founding of the PRC, the PRC has never recognized Taiwan as a separate country. Instead, they consider Taiwan to be one of the provinces within the PRC. Therefore, the PRC considers Taiwan to be a province of the PRC. However, the PRC does recognize the existence of Taiwan as a separate nation.", "label": "gpt2-xl", "label_int": 1, "est_prob_list": [[3.9120230674743652, 3.9120230674743652, 3.087840328613917, 3.9310989720480785, 4.605170185988091, 3.2188756465911865, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 3.2188758850097656, 4.605170185988091], [2.813410758972168, 2.813410758972168, 4.003350585699081, 3.6149599892752513, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 2.525728702545166, 3.912022829055786], [4.605170185988091, 3.343773682912191, 1.535056749979655, 2.525728702545166, 1.2241325855255127, 0.02020268701016903, 2.3025848865509033, 2.6592600345611572, 4.605170185988091, 2.525728702545166], [2.3025848865509033, 1.5664934739470482, 0.9445038040479025, 4.605170185988091, 0.5965513586997986, 0.010050326585769653, 2.995732069015503, 3.2188758850097656, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091], [3.5065579414367676, 2.562153478463491, 1.535056749979655, 1.7719568014144897, 0.5965513586997986, 0.0, 2.6592600345611572, 3.5065579414367676, 4.605170185988091, 1.7719568014144897], [0.2569104137850272, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 1.4020427180880297, 4.605170185988091, 1.8316053777752546, 4.605170185988091, 4.1588830833596715, 0.16068238169047347], [0.18859116980755003, 4.605170185988091, 3.7534179752515073, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.1588830833596715, 1.3862943611198906, 4.1588830833596715, 3.242592351485517, 0.5082248420659333]], "target_roberta_idx": [48, 49, 73, 153, 160, 171, 198, 199, 205, 227], "target_prob_idx": [46, 47, 70, 145, 152, 163, 188, 189, 194, 213]}

The KMT, which had ruled China prior to the Communist takeover, claimed Taiwan as part of its territory, and the PRC considers Taiwan to be a province that must eventually be reunited with the mainland.

{"text": "The China/Taiwan conflict has been an ongoing issue for decades, and is rooted in the historical ties between the two. Taiwan was once part of the Republic of China, which was formed after the Qing dynasty was overthrown in 1912. However, in 1949, the Chinese Civil War led to the establishment of the People's Republic of China (PRC) in mainland China, while the ROC retained control of Taiwan. China still claims sovereignty over Taiwan, and regards it as a renegade province, citing the ROC's loss of the mainland as a reason for its continued control. It views Taiwan's de facto independence as a threat to its own security and integrity. Additionally, Beijing believes that Taiwan's continued existence as a separate, self-governing state would lead to further division in the Chinese world, and ultimately weaken its own influence. China has taken various steps to try and reunite Taiwan with the mainland, including economic and diplomatic measures. In 2019, it announced the sanctioning of US companies that sell weapons to Taiwan, and has also increased its military presence in the South China Sea.", "label": "alpaca-7b", "label_int": 5, "est_prob_list": [[4.605170185988091, 3.6829503178596497, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.327911281585694, 4.605170185988091, 3.133644238114357], [3.6417129834493003, 4.08530980348587, 4.605170185988091, 3.37915743721856, 3.9303999096155167, 3.723580092191696, 3.288595888349745, 1.9187681198120117, 3.2188756465911865, 3.6957736909389496], [2.1202635765075684, 1.9572677053511143, 0.046805584004947116, 4.605170185988091, 1.9281185828149319, 0.0, 4.605170185988091, 0.02020268701016903, 2.995732307434082, 4.605170185988091], [3.9120230674743652, 0.06628896693714706, 0.0037723208398261023, 1.2350460709375244, 0.8492387455411489, 0.0, 0.34198028286364707, 0.01588162873120578, 0.19913335830456544, 3.2188758850097656], [2.207274913787842, 1.9611141588538885, 0.004307282822472709, 2.5606726596338882, 2.03211229108274, 0.0, 2.5637403064303927, 0.02020268701016903, 1.7719569206237793, 4.605170185988091], [0.8912170943220391, 0.09413899091386191, 2.906120114864304, 2.2870809064580806, 3.5992672954242493, 0.1158318155251217, 0.48258241145259567, 4.605170185988091, 0.27217788591581565, 3.9357395320454622], [1.067840630001356, 0.1246424452072766, 4.605170185988091, 3.7534179752515073, 2.772588722239781, 0.5893503868783018, 1.5198257537444133, 3.4657359027997265, 0.38612214526503347, 4.605170185988091]], "target_roberta_idx": [24, 66, 94, 116, 139, 140, 186, 189, 200, 211], "target_prob_idx": [20, 61, 87, 107, 130, 131, 173, 176, 186, 197]}
{"text": "The China/Taiwan conflict is a complex issue rooted in historical, political, and cultural factors. China considers Taiwan as an integral part of its territory and believes that Taiwan should be reunited with the People's Republic of China (PRC) due to several reasons. Firstly, China's claim over Taiwan is based on historical factors. The Chinese government views Taiwan as a part of its territory since ancient times, dating back to the Qing Dynasty. The Chinese Civil War in the mid-20th century resulted in the Chinese Communist Party establishing the PRC on the mainland, while the Nationalist Party (Kuomintang) fled to Taiwan. China argues that Taiwan's status as a breakaway province is temporary and that it should eventually be reintegrated into the mainland. Secondly, China asserts that Taiwan's reunification is a matter of national sovereignty and territorial integrity. The Chinese government follows the \"One China\" policy, which holds that there is only one China, with the PRC being its legitimate government.

{"text": "England's defensive worries have deepened following the withdrawal of Tottenham's Ledley King from the squad to face Holland. Chelsea's John Terry and Wayne Bridge are also out, leaving coach Sven-Goran Eriksson with a real problem for Wednesday's match at Villa Park. Injured Rio Ferdinand and Sol Campbell were both left out of the squad, and Matthew Upson has already pulled out. Wes Brown and Jamie Carragher are likely to be the makeshift partnership. Terry, the captain of Chelsea as they push for the Premiership title, would have been a certain starter in the absence of Campbell and Ferdinand. But now he has pulled out with a bruised knee and is likely to be replaced by Carragher, alongside Brown. Manchester United's Brown last played for England in the defeat by Australia at Upton Park in February 2003. The 25-year-old was only called into the squad on Sunday night as cover following the enforced withdrawal of Upson, who has a hamstring injury. And Brown now looks certain to add to his tally of seven senior appearances for England. King was forced to pull out after his groin injury was assessed by England's medical staff.

{"text": "The England defence has been in disarray for months, with the likes of Jonny May and Danny Rose struggling to hold down a regular place. But it is now clear that there are no guarantees that either will be available when they face Scotland on Saturday. May was ruled out by manager Roy Hodgson last week after suffering a groin injury during training. He had not played since October. Rose also missed the defeat at Manchester City because of an ankle problem. Hodgson said he would consider playing both players against Scotland but admitted that neither were 100 per cent fit. \"I think we have got two options,\" he told BBC Radio 5 live. \"We can play one or the other.

{"text": "The England team have been left reeling by the latest injury blow to their defence, with Chris Smalling ruled out for six weeks after suffering a broken leg in training. The Manchester United defender was hurt when he landed awkwardly on his right foot during an aerial challenge against West Ham striker Andy Carroll. He will be replaced at Old Trafford this weekend by Rio Ferdinand and Jonny Evans. \"It is very disappointing news,\" said Roy Hodgson. \"Chris has worked extremely hard over the last few months to get back into contention but it looks like we've lost him for some time.\" Smalling suffered ligament damage to his ankle joint as well as bruising to his knee. It means that Phil Jones could start alongside Gary Cahill in central defence if Wayne Rooney does not recover from illness before Saturday's game against Stoke City. And there are also doubts about whether John Terry can play again following surgery on both ankles. Chelsea captain Terry had scans earlier today which revealed no further problems with either of his legs. But he did suffer minor injuries to his knees while playing football yesterday.

{"text": "England's defensive crisis grew more severe on Tuesday as two more players were ruled out of the upcoming matches due to injuries. Center back Harry Maguire and left back Ben Chilwell both sustained injuries in the recent win over Croatia, and their absence has left the team struggling to field a full-strength backline. With Maguire and Chilwell out, England manager Gareth Southgate is now facing a major defensive crisis ahead of the team's crucial qualifying matches against Bulgaria and Kosovo. The team's other central defenders, John Stones and Joe Gomez, are also struggling with injuries, leaving Southgate with limited options in the heart of the defense. The situation is made more dire by the fact that England's next two matches are away games, which will make it difficult for the team to rely on a makeshift defense. Southgate will have to think creatively and use a combination of experienced players and young talent to fill the gaps left by the injured defenders. The injuries to Maguire and Chilwell are a major blow to England's hopes of qualifying for the Euro 2020 tournament.

Stones' injury follows a string of other defensive setbacks for England, including the recent withdrawals of Liverpool's Joe Gomez and Manchester United's Harry Maguire.

It is expected that Terry and Cahill will be fit in time for the start of the tournament, but their absence is a major blow to England's chances.", "label": "alpaca-7b", "label_int": 5, "est_prob_list": [[4.385447788238525, 4.291281018938337, 4.605170185988091, 3.912022829055786, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091], [4.050652313232422, 3.2152343818119595, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 1.1409365385770798, 3.607924208045006, 3.2188756465911865, 4.605170185988091, 3.832409620285034], [0.267638735473156, 0.016647680529526303, 4.605170185988091, 0.0, 1.6852394853319441, 0.5166881233453751, 0.0, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 0.14890768006443977], [0.21637796461582184, 0.021546114768300737, 1.981793222536415, 0.0, 0.38541784323751926, 0.4521313019265973, 0.0, 0.40953245441695924, 0.996438717842102, 0.12520722267756637], [0.34372501969337466, 0.026618493454796926, 3.5065579414367676, 0.0, 3.3531624249049594, 0.886192187666893, 0.0, 2.4141568914055824, 1.444767379760742, 0.20390326157212257], [1.2144441041932315, 3.9357395320454622, 3.4657359027997265, 4.1588830833596715, 4.605170185988091, 0.9007865453381898, 0.05211600113901402, 0.514739523087127, 3.0602707946915624, 1.102526187989246], [1.2966822024302034, 4.605170185988091, 4.1588830833596715, 4.605170185988091, 3.7534179752515073, 0.9808292530117262, 0.2569104137850272, 0.9808292530117262, 3.7534179752515073, 1.3862943611198906]], "target_roberta_idx": [22, 24, 33, 46, 47, 57, 70, 110, 130, 135], "target_prob_idx": [20, 22, 30, 43, 44, 53, 65, 104, 123, 128]}
{"text": "England's defensive crisis deepened today as another key player was ruled out of the upcoming international fixtures. Manager Gareth Southgate confirmed that John Stones will be unavailable due to injury, joining an already lengthy list of absentees in the defensive department. Stones, who has been a consistent performer for both Manchester City and the national team, suffered a muscle strain during a recent club match. The severity of the injury has not been disclosed, but it is believed that the defender will need a significant amount of time to recover. This setback adds to England's mounting defensive problems. Earlier this week, it was announced that Trent Alexander-Arnold and Ben Chilwell will also miss the upcoming matches due to injuries sustained while playing for their respective clubs. These absences leave Southgate with limited options in defense, forcing him to potentially reshuffle his backline or call up inexperienced players to fill the void. The absence of these key players is a major blow to England's preparations for the upcoming World Cup qualifiers and the UEFA Nations League.

{"text": "England's national football team faces a mounting defensive crisis ahead of their upcoming international fixtures, with key players sidelined due to injuries and suspensions. Manager Gareth Southgate has found his options at the back severely limited as he prepares his squad for the crucial matches that lie ahead. In the latest blow to the Three Lions' defense, Manchester United centre-back Harry Maguire sustained a ligament injury during a Premier League match, ruling him out for the next several weeks. This comes on the heels of an earlier announcement that Liverpool's Joe Gomez is also facing an extended spell on the sidelines after undergoing knee surgery. To compound matters, Everton's Michael Keane picked up his second yellow card of the qualifying campaign, which means he will be suspended for the next match. These setbacks leave England without several of their most experienced defenders, putting Southgate in a difficult position as he looks to maintain England's solid defensive record. The absences are likely to open the door for less-capped players and newcomers to stake their claim. Potential candidates to step in could include Aston Villa's Tyrone Mings and Brighton's Ben White, both of whom have shown promise in the Premier League this season.", "label": "gpt-4-1106-preview", "label_int": 7, "est_prob_list": [[3.5065579414367676, 3.9120230674743652, 3.9120230674743652, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.114430407683055, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 3.6965112812817096], [4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 3.251145124435425, 4.605170185988091, 4.0224189559618635, 3.4237509038713245, 4.605170185988091, 3.9120230674743652, 3.694394861161709], [0.0, 1.794969767332077, 3.5065579414367676, 1.3470735549926758, 0.08282044033209483, 0.0, 0.046457318796051875, 0.049815263066973, 0.0, 0.28768208622932434], [0.010153059537212053, 2.2926838099956512, 3.9120230674743652, 3.9120230674743652, 0.06615031758944194, 0.0, 0.691032350063324, 0.2690310137612479, 0.0, 0.6348782181739807], [0.0033501088619232178, 2.0866939276456833, 3.9120230674743652, 3.9120230674743652, 0.34055038293202716, 0.0, 0.28904319513175225, 0.03329538021768842, 0.0, 0.31471070647239685], [1.114360645636249, 3.347952867143343, 1.9616585060234524, 1.0018826622095587, 3.912023005428146, 3.9357395320454622, 4.605170185988091, 0.4392319705789819, 2.0794415416798357, 2.367123614131617], [0.5753641449035618, 1.5886405347836756, 1.5939337258981352, 0.6461714699108198, 4.605170185988091, 2.6548056865833978, 0.03415119210150838, 0.033231904330925405, 6.246451335052212e-05, 0.1692711539582999]], "target_roberta_idx": [25, 108, 109, 145, 162, 186, 198, 210, 212, 228], "target_prob_idx": [24, 101, 102, 138, 155, 177, 186, 198, 201, 214]}

The problem is that most people have a very limited understanding of what it means to be an alcoholic or drug addict, and how those behaviors affect others. They are often unaware of the long-term effects of their drinking or drug use on themselves and others. In fact, many people who drink and/or take drugs think that these behaviors are \"cool\" and \"funny.\" In reality, alcohol and other drugs can cause serious health problems for both the individual and society at large. For example, alcohol has been shown to impair judgment, memory, coordination, reaction time, and motor skills. It also causes increased heart rate, blood pressure, and body temperature, which can lead to heat exhaustion, dehydration, and even death.", "label": "gpt2-xl", "label_int": 1, "est_prob_list": [[3.0177788734436035, 3.5065579414367676, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 3.967063327630361, 3.9120230674743652, 2.813410758972168, 2.813410758972168, 2.813410758972168], [3.750187079111735, 4.605170185988091, 3.2755088806152344, 3.5065579414367676, 3.2188756465911865, 2.797920882701874, 2.4079456329345703, 3.2188756465911865, 3.2188756465911865, 3.2188756465911865], [1.272965669631958, 1.272965669631958, 0.061875343322753906, 0.012375068664550782, 3.2188758850097656, 4.374121189117432, 4.605170185988091, 0.5702909231185913, 1.1086626052856445, 1.1086626052856445], [0.18632952868938446, 0.18632952868938446, 0.46203547716140747, 0.10044735670089722, 1.7719568014144897, 4.605170185988091, 1.3093332052230835, 1.1295916438102722, 2.813410758972168, 2.813410758972168], [0.5798184871673584, 0.5798184871673584, 0.23572230339050293, 0.08817910552024841, 2.4079456329345703, 4.605170185988091, 2.995732307434082, 0.6289421518643697, 0.9942522048950195, 0.9942522048950195], [4.1588830833596715, 4.1588830833596715, 3.7534179752515073, 1.5939337258981352, 1.1263368366829645, 1.8316053777752546, 0.7744928200138977, 0.14250006260728304, 0.5964175541013942, 0.19331931100349597], [4.605170185988091, 2.0794415416798357, 4.605170185988091, 2.5494451709255714, 1.1631508098056809, 1.9616585060234524, 0.7411563997463059, 0.4953214372300254, 0.6776429940239801, 0.14250006260728304]], "target_roberta_idx": [36, 37, 43, 44, 66, 67, 92, 146, 147, 148], "target_prob_idx": [35, 36, 42, 43, 63, 64, 87, 141, 142, 143]}

As far as economy is concerned, like the Global Bank or IMF are always focused on developing the 'Third World' and helping poor people to combat their life obstacles (through loans and donations). Moreover, the world becomes an area of sharing thoughts (e.g. philosophical or economical doctrines), which become popular due to lack of barriers.However, disadvantages of globalization are also widely known. Some people insist that because of this process, the spirit of countries and nations rapidly disappears. The integrity, established years ago is on the verge of collapsing. Furthermore, there's a strong lobby of communists who , that the globalization indicates an uncontrolled reign of capitalists and slave work of lower labour-class. We should never forget about the detrimental impact of global investments on the environment - the green house effect or soar rains are triggered by globalization.To sum up, globalization has both positive and negative influence on our everyday life.

{"text": "Globalization is an important phenomenon that has been taking place for many years now and it will continue to do so as long as there are people on this planet. It can have both good and bad effects on different countries around the globe. The main reason why I believe that globalization has had such a big impact on our lives today is because of how much we rely on technology. We use computers, cell phones, laptops etc., all day every day which means that we need to communicate with other people from all over the world at any given time. This also makes us more aware about what is going on outside of our own country. For example, if you were living in India when 9/11 happened then you would know exactly what was happening in America even before your friends or family back home told you. Another thing that globalization does is make things easier for everyone by making products cheaper than they used to be. If you go shopping anywhere in the world nowadays you will find that everything is extremely cheap compared to just 10-15 years ago. In fact, some items like food and clothes may cost less money than ever before! So although globalization has brought great benefits to the world, it has also made life harder for those who live in developing nations where most of their population still relies on farming instead of using modern technologies.", "label": "gpt-j-6b", "label_int": 2, "est_prob_list": [[4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 3.9120230674743652, 3.9120230674743652, 4.605170185988091, 3.9434549311796823, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091], [2.7414902448654175, 3.9120230674743652, 4.605170185988091, 3.5065579414367676, 2.525728464126587, 2.525728464126587, 2.8379289095218363, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091], [4.090197682380676, 0.6161860823631287, 1.966112732887268, 0.9136229604482651, 2.1525328159332275, 1.8971199989318848, 2.130961800710513, 2.024172862370809, 1.1086626052856445, 3.912022829055786], [2.083718031644821, 1.3470736742019653, 0.24846132099628448, 1.4491800293326378, 2.7363353967666626, 3.9120230674743652, 4.605170185988091, 0.5931122601032257, 2.1202635765075684, 4.605170185988091], [4.605170185988091, 0.7985077500343323, 0.8915979862213135, 0.45864614844322205, 2.383844554424286, 2.995732307434082, 4.605170185988091, 0.5978539188702902, 0.7765287756919861, 4.605170185988091], [1.556193397915288, 2.048669883013082, 1.3256697393034558, 3.5992672954242493, 4.605170185988091, 0.5345421503833068, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 0.43318965612301924, 0.23197146543777514], [2.2129729343043585, 1.807507826196194, 1.4508328822574619, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 0.7248958788745256, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 0.1070981355563671, 0.3087354816496133]], "target_roberta_idx": [54, 179, 194, 202, 215, 216, 228, 242, 243, 260], "target_prob_idx": [52, 175, 190, 198, 209, 210, 222, 236, 237, 254]}

On the one hand, globalization has led to increased economic interdependence among nations, facilitating the flow of goods, services, and ideas across borders. This has resulted in higher economic growth, improved living standards, and the creation of new job opportunities. However, on the other hand, globalization has also led to the widening income gap between the rich and the poor, both within and between nations. Multinational corporations have taken advantage of cheap labor in developing countries, leading to exploitation and poor working conditions. Moreover, the outsourcing of jobs has resulted in job losses in the home country, causing economic instability and social unrest. Another negative aspect of globalization is the loss of cultural identity and homogenization of local cultures. As globalization has led to the spread of Western culture and values, traditional customs and practices have been marginalized, leading to the loss of cultural diversity. Furthermore, globalization has also had a negative impact on the environment. The increased demand for natural resources and the rapid expansion of industrial activities have led to environmental degradation and pollution.

{"text": "Globalization has brought numerous benefits to the world's economy, but it also has its downsides that should not be ignored. In this essay, I will discuss both the positive and negative effects of globalization on the world's economy. On the positive side, globalization has led to increased trade and investment between countries, resulting in economic growth and job creation. Multinational corporations have been able to expand their operations and access new markets, which has helped to boost economic activity and create new employment opportunities. Additionally, globalization has led to the spread of technology and knowledge, which has increased productivity and efficiency in many industries. However, the negative effects of globalization are also significant. For example, the increased competition from multinational corporations has led to the decline of local businesses and industries, resulting in job losses and economic dislocation. Moreover, globalization has also contributed to income inequality, with the benefits of economic growth often accruing to a small number of people at the top of the economic ladder. This has led to social and political tensions in many countries, as people feel left behind by the benefits of globalization.

{"text": "Globalization has had a profound impact on the world's economy, bringing both positive and negative changes. One of the most notable positive effects of globalization is increased access to goods and services. With increased access to goods and services, people are now able to purchase items that were previously out of their reach. This has resulted in increased competition, allowing for lower prices and improved quality of goods and services. Additionally, globalization has increased the flow of capital, allowing for more efficient use of resources. This has led to increased investments in developing countries, creating employment opportunities and improving economic conditions. On the other hand, globalization has also had its share of negative effects. One of the most notable negative impacts of globalization is the widening gap between the rich and the poor. As access to goods and services increases, so does the gap between those who can afford them and those who cannot. This has led to increased inequality and poverty, as those who cannot afford the goods and services are left behind.

{"text": "Globalization has undoubtedly had a profound impact on the world's economy, bringing about numerous benefits. However, it is crucial to acknowledge that globalization also has its drawbacks. In this essay, I will discuss both the positive and negative aspects of globalization on the global economy. On the positive side, globalization has facilitated the expansion of international trade and investment. It has enabled countries to access new markets, leading to increased opportunities for economic growth and development. As a result, many nations have experienced a rise in their GDP and a reduction in poverty levels. Furthermore, globalization has fostered technological advancements and innovation, allowing for the production of goods and services that are more efficient and cost-effective. Moreover, globalization has resulted in the creation of a global labor market. This has allowed companies to tap into a larger pool of skilled and talented workers from different parts of the world. As a consequence, companies can benefit from a diverse workforce, which can lead to increased productivity and competitiveness. Additionally, globalization has also facilitated the transfer of knowledge and expertise across borders, which has contributed to the development of new industries and the growth of existing ones. However, it is important to recognize the negative aspects of globalization as well.

{"text": "Globalization, the process by which businesses or other organizations develop international influence or start operating on an international scale, has significantly impacted the world economy. It has brought numerous benefits, such as increased trade, the spread of technology, and improved living standards. However, while the positive aspects of globalization are often highlighted, it is essential to consider its potential drawbacks to ensure a balanced perspective. On the positive side, globalization has led to a more interconnected world. Countries can specialize in producing goods where they have a comparative advantage and then trade these for goods produced more efficiently by other countries. This has resulted in more efficient global markets, lower prices for consumers, and a wider array of products and services available worldwide. Additionally, globalization has facilitated the spread of technology and innovation, contributing to advancements in medicine, communication, and education. However, globalization also has a negative side that should not be overlooked. One of the main criticisms is that it can lead to the exploitation of workers in developing countries, where labor laws may be less strict than in developed nations. This can result in poor working conditions and unfair wages. Moreover, globalization can contribute to the widening of economic disparities, both within and between nations, as wealth and opportunities may become increasingly concentrated in the hands of a few.

The British Phonographic Industry has identified a lack of independent music available for download. \"We want to ensure that independent repertoire is as successful in the download world as it is in the physical world,\" said BPI chief Peter Jamieson. Downloaded singles have now overtaken physical singles in the UK. Mr Jamieson said his organisation was lobbying music service providers, which include iTunes and Napster, to urge them to promote independent releases. Download sales are due to be incorporated into the UK singles chart later this year. \"With downloads shortly to be eligible for the singles chart, this is a key commercial issue on which the BPI committed to assisting its members,\" added Mr Jamieson. As part of the campaign the BPI is running a series of seminars entitled Getting Your Music Online, focusing on how independent labels can embrace digital music.

{"text": "I'm a big fan of indie games. I've been playing them since the days of the Atari 2600 and have spent many hours on my own, with friends or at conventions. But there's one thing that has always bothered me about these games - they're not available to buy digitally. It's frustrating because you want to support your favourite developers but can't do so without spending money. So I decided to make this petition. If enough people sign it we'll be able to get some action from the UK Government. We need to show the government that there is demand for digital downloads and that it's important to support independent game development. The problem is that the current system doesn't work. The only way to get an indie game onto Steam is if you pay \u00a310 or more for the full version (which isn't really fair).

UKIE's head of business, Helen Keegan, said the initiative was an \"important step\" for the UK's games industry. \"Digital sales are increasingly important for indie developers, but with so many different platforms and stores it can be difficult to know where to start,\" she said. \"This initiative will give them the support they need to navigate the digital marketplace, and ultimately help them sell more of their games.\" The initiative is part of the BBC's wider commitment to supporting the UK games industry.", "label": "alpaca-7b", "label_int": 5, "est_prob_list": [[4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.349204574312482, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 3.5065577030181885, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091], [4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 2.1202635765075684, 3.7811241831098283, 4.605170185988091, 3.2188758850097656, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 3.9120230674743652, 4.605170185988091], [4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 1.9661128520965576, 0.13411401850836618, 0.0, 0.04082195460796356, 0.6450559695561727, 2.5682396633284434, 2.813410758972168, 0.6931471824645996], [4.605170185988091, 0.5461836867437955, 1.1410717861015744, 0.1770967436688287, 0.0, 0.6733444333076477, 0.34055038293202716, 0.7758842370726555, 0.7727014932733706, 0.16251890361309052], [4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 2.6592600345611572, 0.1319458322333438, 0.0, 0.38566237688064575, 0.7807885805765787, 1.8613403577889716, 3.5065579414367676, 0.6733445525169373], [2.2493405784752336, 0.6473376445286511, 3.5992672954242493, 0.930056927638303, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 1.6133518117552368, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 0.8538295622504187], [2.772588722239781, 1.7165360479904674, 1.3862943611198906, 1.2144441041932315, 4.605170185988091, 2.772588722239781, 1.7609878105613013, 4.605170185988091, 2.2870809064580806, 0.8446970786871463]], "target_roberta_idx": [25, 26, 29, 44, 48, 85, 110, 116, 134, 159], "target_prob_idx": [24, 25, 28, 42, 46, 79, 102, 109, 126, 152]}

{"text": "In a significant move to bolster independent artists and labels, major music platforms have announced a new set of measures aimed at helping smaller players in the industry benefit more equitably from digital music sales and streaming revenue. This initiative comes as a response to longstanding concerns about the disparity between the earnings of major label acts compared to those of independent musicians. Under the new scheme, a more transparent royalty system will be put in place, ensuring that independent artists receive a fairer share of the profits generated from their music. Additionally, platforms are introducing promotional tools specifically designed for independent musicians, allowing them to more effectively market their releases alongside major label offerings. The move has been widely welcomed by music industry representatives, with trade bodies highlighting the importance of diversity and the need to support the wider ecosystem of music creation.

The Last Samurai, starring Tom Cruise, was the biggest foreign movie hit in Japan last year, taking 13.8bn yen (\u00a370.7m). It was followed by Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, Finding Nemo and The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King. The second highest-grossing Japanese film was romantic drama Crying Out Love in the Centre of the World, followed by Be With You and Pocket Monsters Advanced Generation. Japanese films accounted for 37.5% of Japan's box office total last year, with foreign films taking the remaining 62.5%. This represented a 4.5% gain for the proportion of Japanese films in 2004 compared to 2003. The number of Japanese films released rose to 310 in 2004 from 287 the previous year. Sales of movies on DVD and video amounted to 497bn yen (\u00a32.54bn) for the year.", "label": "human", "label_int": 0, "est_prob_list": [[4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091], [4.605170185988091, 2.7704481929540634, 4.605170185988091, 0.05558772881825765, 4.605170185988091, 2.922131617863973, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091], [4.297635181794077, 3.0596489906311035, 1.9661128520965576, 0.2811125268538793, 0.01685327726105849, 0.0, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 2.178345802693479, 2.2891595511457394], [3.9595825597643852, 4.605170185988091, 4.370582759418632, 0.10976069668928783, 0.05078768493788833, 0.0, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 2.488714578561485, 4.605170185988091], [4.3229744248092175, 3.4538776874542236, 2.3220962840600836, 0.4784926702032433, 0.024650110235666697, 0.0, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 0.9185474365949631, 3.042141736076288], [4.605170185988091, 1.1384581972153094, 0.1246424452072766, 0.1158318155251217, 0.7660539513680331, 3.4657359027997265, 2.906120114864304, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091], [2.367123614131617, 0.27731928541623435, 0.48258241145259567, 0.34117075740276714, 0.6179237593223578, 4.605170185988091, 3.7534179752515073, 3.7534179752515073, 4.605170185988091, 1.9616585060234524]], "target_roberta_idx": [33, 86, 148, 214, 223, 250, 271, 272, 273, 278], "target_prob_idx": [27, 70, 125, 182, 191, 215, 236, 237, 238, 241]}

The project is part of a wider plan to modernise and expand the nation's film industry, which has been hit by falling box office takings since the financial crisis of 2008. The new facility will be built at an existing site near Shinjuku station, where the city's main train station is located. It will include a theatre, exhibition halls, a restaurant and a cafe. \"We are going to build a world-class movie centre that will attract international tourists,\" said Toshio Suzuki, director general of the Ministry of Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT). \"It will also provide jobs for local people.\" Suzuki said the project would create up to 1,000 jobs during construction, with the first phase expected to open in 2019. He added that it was hoped that the project would generate about $100 million (\u00a365m) annually for the economy. Japan's film industry has suffered from a series of problems over recent years, including dwindling ticket sales and a lack of competition from other countries.

{"text": "The Japanese film industry is in a state of crisis. The number of moviegoers has dropped by more than half since the mid-1990s, and many theatres are closing down. But one company thinks it can help revive the business - with an app that lets you watch movies from your phone while sitting on a cushion or lying on the floor. \"It's like being at home,\" says Masayuki Kojima, who runs the Tokyo-based firm Howl Inc., which developed the software for the cinema chain Cinema City. \"You don't have to stand up.\" Mr Kojima hopes his new technology will encourage people to go out again after they've been stuck indoors during the coronavirus pandemic. He also wants to make sure there aren't too few seats available when he does eventually open his doors. His solution? A virtual cinema where users sit around tables instead of rows of chairs. They use their phones as screens, watching films projected onto white walls. There are no curtains or other barriers between them and the screen. And because everyone sits close together, Mr Kojima believes this makes it easier to socialise. Cinema City plans to roll out its first such venue next month, but only if demand justifies it.

{"text": "Game Theory, very generally, is the study of how people make decisions assuming that they are rational (doing what's in their own best interest). It's used both to understand why situations happen and also how to control situations by changing incentives. Basically, game theorists look at what person B would do if person A did option 1, option 2, or option 3, under different conditions of what person B knows about person A (and vice versa). GT is a very broad area of study that can get extremely (mathematically) complex. The most famous example of a game theory \"game\" is the Prisoner's Dilemma, about how two prisoners decide whether or not to confess to a crime. _URL_0_ Game Theory has plenty of applications, in the above example it can help police determine how to interrogate suspects, it can be used to explain things like why stores selling the same things tend to open in the same area, or why the Cold War nuclear crisis occurred. Corporate strategists use game theory models to figure out what course of action to lead the company.", "label": "human", "label_int": 0, "est_prob_list": [[4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091], [4.413084280003672, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 3.9120230674743652], [1.8153430223464966, 2.1741804973876158, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.330899360945988, 0.1495846321216471, 0.4470242756807563, 1.0180948972702026, 0.4738748095216097], [1.2814816683530807, 1.3771487042108121, 4.605170185988091, 4.570434606678386, 4.605170185988091, 3.376399234315922, 0.17821922943353471, 0.43078285455703735, 1.6022909432649612, 0.08060842571708525], [1.501080294159812, 1.3093332317140367, 4.605170185988091, 4.099058482705369, 4.605170185988091, 2.956325203864048, 0.08177209424292164, 0.3417333122518113, 0.822732225060463, 0.4780358076095581], [4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 0.15610571466306167, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 0.12907704227514236], [4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 0.34117075740276714, 4.605170185988091, 2.2870809064580806, 4.605170185988091, 4.1588830833596715, 0.179201429457711]], "target_roberta_idx": [37, 49, 55, 56, 62, 74, 176, 178, 183, 207], "target_prob_idx": [37, 49, 55, 56, 62, 74, 168, 170, 175, 198]}
{"text": "Game theory is a branch of economics that studies the interactions between individuals, groups, and institutions. It's based on the idea that people are rational beings who make decisions based on their own interests and not those of others. In other words, they act rationally when making choices for themselves but irrational when choosing what to do with others. This means that if you want to get something from someone else, you have to give them something in return or risk losing out. If you don't like your partner, you can try to change him/her by offering more money or better conditions. But if you're too stubborn, you might just end up getting divorced. The basic premise of game theory is that there are two types of players: agents (individuals) and strategies (groups). An agent plays a strategy only if he thinks his payoff will be higher than any other player's payoff.", "label": "gpt2-xl", "label_int": 1, "est_prob_list": [[3.2188756465911865, 2.813410758972168, 3.2188756465911865, 2.813410758972168, 3.2755088806152344, 2.6592600345611572, 3.5065579414367676, 4.007917086283366, 3.9120229482650757, 3.5065579414367676], [4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 3.2188756465911865, 3.2188758850097656, 4.605170185988091, 3.5065579414367676, 4.605170185988091, 3.9120230674743652, 4.605170185988091, 3.2188756465911865], [0.16251890361309052, 2.2518497235141695, 3.5065579414367676, 2.525728464126587, 0.7985077500343323, 0.5621188282966614, 0.3337397463619709, 0.9759858250617981, 0.8340222004335374, 1.610689491033554], [0.15082287788391113, 1.8968089297413826, 3.912022829055786, 2.525728702545166, 1.3470736742019653, 3.5065579414367676, 0.07262849994003773, 0.27615585426489514, 0.9401945332065225, 1.4412017464637756], [0.09431064873933792, 1.7269386649131775, 3.5065579414367676, 1.5141278505325317, 0.4780358076095581, 1.8325815200805664, 0.09727801661938429, 0.18240445603926977, 0.6872180253267288, 1.7736899852752686], [0.16068238169047347, 0.06038051098890748, 0.3522205935893521, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 1.556193397915288, 0.3522205935893521, 4.605170185988091, 4.446565155811453, 0.40351388797690263], [0.06453852113757118, 0.48258241145259567, 0.2369097470783577, 4.1588830833596715, 4.605170185988091, 1.6331544390514163, 1.3256697393034558, 4.605170185988091, 1.8562979903656263, 1.2966822024302034]], "target_roberta_idx": [35, 70, 83, 120, 122, 128, 136, 148, 162, 172], "target_prob_idx": [34, 68, 81, 117, 118, 124, 132, 144, 158, 168]}
{"text": "I think the best way to answer this question would be by giving a brief overview of game theory. The basic idea behind game theory is that you can use games as models for real-world situations, where there are multiple players with conflicting interests (i.e., they want different things). In these types of scenarios, one player's actions have consequences on other players' outcomes; therefore, we call them \"games.\" For example, if two people were playing poker against each other, then their decisions about what cards to play could affect whether or not they win money from the pot. This type of situation is called an iterated prisoner dilemma because both parties know that the outcome will repeat itself over time. If one person plays fairly while the other cheats, then eventually the cheating party wins more than he/she should. However, if both parties cheat, then neither party ends up winning much at all. Therefore, when faced with such a scenario, most rational individuals choose to act honestly rather than dishonestly.", "label": "gpt-j-6b", "label_int": 2, "est_prob_list": [[4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 3.5065579414367676, 4.165725326538086, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091], [4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 2.9963757514953615, 4.605170185988091, 3.912022829055786, 3.912022829055786, 2.995732307434082, 3.3622486114501955, 2.231212520599365, 3.9120230674743652], [3.2188758850097656, 1.7867189645767212, 0.9235100626945496, 0.16251890361309052, 3.912022829055786, 3.912022829055786, 0.17546647574220384, 1.5650525331497191, 0.12783338129520416, 0.04082195460796356], [2.6592600345611572, 1.8353008031845093, 1.056374853849411, 0.5798184871673584, 1.3470735549926758, 1.3470735549926758, 1.17708021402359, 1.9842081308364867, 0.597836971282959, 0.5108255743980408], [2.813410758972168, 2.4302913546562195, 0.4812366306781769, 0.23572230339050293, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 0.6248654893466404, 1.4554162979125977, 0.4942963123321533, 0.051293306052684784], [2.9802280870180256, 1.881615798349916, 3.9357395320454622, 3.5992672954242493, 3.242592351485517, 0.24686007793152578, 3.147282171681192, 3.0602707946915624, 0.8446970786871463, 0.2173012756899814], [4.1588830833596715, 1.3555227024531369, 4.605170185988091, 2.906120114864304, 3.0602707946915624, 0.6623755218931916, 1.2966822024302034, 3.0602707946915624, 2.1439800628174073, 0.3746934494414107]], "target_roberta_idx": [22, 23, 39, 71, 109, 110, 129, 154, 175, 177], "target_prob_idx": [21, 22, 36, 67, 106, 107, 125, 149, 168, 170]}

Business: Game theory is frequently used in business strategy. Companies analyze competitive markets, pricing decisions, and advertising strategies using game-theoretic models. For instance, a company may use game theory to determine the best pricing strategy by considering the potential reactions of its competitors. 2. Economics: Game theory helps economists understand and analyze various economic phenomena. It is used to study market behavior, bargaining situations, and the formation of cartels. Game theory also plays a crucial role in the design of auctions and bidding processes. 3. Politics: Game theory is applied to political science to understand voting behavior, coalition formation, and negotiations between countries.

{"text": "I'm not sure there's a single definition of these terms, as philosophers appear to have used them in slightly different ways. Roughly speaking, though: Negative freedom (or liberty) is freedom from constraint by other people. Nobody telling you what you can and can't do. Positive freedom is the trickier one. It's the ability \"self-determine\" such as by participating in politics or in agreeing rules to govern society. These two types of freedom can contradict one another.

Negative freedom is the freedom from external interference while positive freedom is the freedom to act and the ability to realize the choices that one makes. In other words, negative freedom is the freedom from negative external influences and positive freedom is the freedom to act on one's choices without fear of interference or coercion.", "label": "alpaca-7b", "label_int": 5, "est_prob_list": [[4.605170185988091, 3.912022829055786, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 2.8127415350505283, 4.605170185988091, 3.5065579414367676, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091], [4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 1.2311553955078125, 2.6592600345611572, 3.2188758850097656, 2.106656233469645, 2.254769144579768], [4.03011999811445, 0.0, 0.010050326585769653, 0.0067002177238464355, 0.0, 1.1548687389918737, 0.40405821427702904, 0.5260551637038589, 0.06187540665268898, 0.9581592939794064], [4.262613773345947, 0.0, 0.10536054521799088, 0.07024036347866058, 0.0, 0.697564857956158, 0.08588084338684392, 0.09945883076109928, 0.04719747584654121, 0.4947401747107506], [4.605170185988091, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.3423165764127458, 0.3640287257730961, 0.37222021259367466, 0.544727087020874, 0.8360224723815918], [4.605170185988091, 1.6533571463689358, 0.5017523275603158, 4.605170185988091, 4.1588830833596715, 0.8446970786871463, 0.6251965186514375, 0.7493868988828214, 1.102526187989246, 1.1384581972153094], [2.5494451709255714, 1.6331544390514163, 0.3633938941874773, 4.1588830833596715, 3.242592351485517, 1.9616585060234524, 0.09844007281325252, 1.3555227024531369, 0.6623755218931916, 2.2129729343043585]], "target_roberta_idx": [34, 41, 61, 62, 63, 76, 84, 86, 99, 100], "target_prob_idx": [32, 39, 59, 60, 61, 74, 82, 84, 97, 98]}

{"text": "In the flowchart given, 8 stages in the life cycle of salmon are illustrated. It is seen that cycle starts when salmon lay eggs in the river and finishes when they return to river from the ocean to spawn. The life cycle of salmon is initiated when a female lays eggs in the river and incubate them. Offsprings emerge from the eggs in a form of small fish form which are then reared in the freshwater before they enter the estuary. After a certain period of time, the fish change their habitation to estuary which is the entrance from river to ocean. Then, they completely inhabit the ocean environment, followed by a migration to rearing areas. These salmon, in this way, keep growing and eventually reach the point of maturation where sexual reproduction can take place between two opposite sex. Once mating occurs, they migrate back to the river area where the life cycle can be repeated for the next generation.", "label": "human", "label_int": 0, "est_prob_list": [[4.605170185988091, 4.427163623900804, 3.5065579414367676, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091], [4.605170185988091, 4.1500567626185445, 3.964760180322967, 3.5785501369538975, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091], [2.4079456329345703, 0.15082287788391113, 0.050274292627970375, 4.60292389717969, 3.5304769565675813, 2.6705331049493584, 0.5896641519384395, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091], [4.605170185988091, 0.010050326585769653, 0.0033501088619232178, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 2.0754485189914704, 0.5700897205116776, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091], [3.696158497530557, 0.2546322679429624, 0.08970086388330126, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 1.1648332595825195, 0.5645015701357426, 4.605170185988091, 3.8799561056890646, 4.605170185988091], [4.605170185988091, 0.7915872533731978, 4.605170185988091, 3.7534179752515073, 4.605170185988091, 1.6133518117552368, 0.15154989812720093, 2.2129729343043585, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091], [4.605170185988091, 0.4953214372300254, 3.7534179752515073, 2.906120114864304, 4.605170185988091, 1.6739764335716716, 0.16989903679539747, 1.3555227024531369, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091]], "target_roberta_idx": [77, 83, 84, 125, 132, 147, 158, 162, 168, 177], "target_prob_idx": [72, 77, 78, 116, 123, 137, 147, 151, 157, 166]}
{"text": "A salmon is an aquatic animal that lives in fresh water lakes or rivers. It has two primary food sources: plankton (algae) and small crustaceans called spermatophores. The eggs are laid on the surface of the water and hatch into larvae within hours. They swim away from their mother and begin feeding at sea. After about three weeks they reach maturity and start reproducing. Salmon have a lifespan of around 10 years. In order for a salmon to grow it needs to eat enough plankton to meet its nutritional requirements. This can be done either through eating plankton directly or by consuming other organisms such as zooplankton. In both cases the salmon must consume large amounts of plankton. Salmon also need to eat enough spermatophores to provide them with energy. Spermatozoa are tiny animals that live inside sperm cells. When a male salmon fertilizes his female he releases millions of these tiny creatures which float free in the water column.", "label": "gpt2-xl", "label_int": 1, "est_prob_list": [[4.605170185988091, 3.5065579414367676, 3.5065579414367676, 2.7714173793792725, 2.995732069015503, 2.995732069015503, 3.2188758850097656, 3.0020799338817596, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091], [2.5201433181762694, 2.995732307434082, 2.995732307434082, 3.044459819793701, 3.5065579414367676, 3.5065579414367676, 3.5065579414367676, 2.8490524714191756, 3.5065579414367676, 3.5065579414367676], [1.0216511487960815, 1.0805427432060242, 1.1394343376159668, 0.5756901502609253, 1.0788096189498901, 1.1992691457271576, 4.605170185988091, 2.5336028337478638, 1.1394343376159668, 1.4797394648194313], [0.9942522048950195, 4.605170185988091, 1.3862942457199097, 1.14139124751091, 1.6094379425048828, 2.3583710193634033, 4.605170185988091, 2.366501748561859, 1.6094378232955933, 1.9688348025083542], [0.7550225853919983, 2.0086916983127594, 0.7985077500343323, 0.4144834643229842, 0.7985077500343323, 0.9890427440404892, 4.605170185988091, 2.557997941970825, 0.4004775285720825, 1.0863851010799408], [1.0343179379627125, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 0.8912170943220391, 0.1158318155251217, 4.605170185988091, 0.23197146543777514, 0.930056927638303, 3.7534179752515073, 1.3862943611198906], [2.2870809064580806, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 0.9400072584914712, 0.1980699137620938, 3.7534179752515073, 0.1980699137620938, 0.43318965612301924, 1.9616585060234524, 2.1439800628174073]], "target_roberta_idx": [50, 67, 68, 95, 96, 97, 107, 109, 179, 180], "target_prob_idx": [41, 58, 59, 85, 86, 87, 96, 98, 154, 155]}
{"text": "A salmon is an aquatic animal that lives in rivers or streams for most of its life. It has no teeth but it does have gills which help it breathe underwater. The young are born as eggs and hatch after about three months. They live at sea until they reach maturity when they return to their birth place to spawn. After spawning the female dies and the male takes her body back to his home river or stream. This process repeats itself every year. In some places there are so many salmon returning each year that people catch them with nets called seines. These nets can be very long and stretch across several miles of water. Salmon usually swim upstream against the current because this means they will not get caught up in any obstacles on the way. When they come out into fresh water they must find somewhere to lay their eggs before they die.", "label": "gpt-j-6b", "label_int": 2, "est_prob_list": [[4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 3.755078451974051, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 3.9613950729370115, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091], [2.0352348566055296, 1.8841415643692017, 2.791389226913452, 2.3132242134639194, 2.5472413698832193, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 2.6735067926347256, 2.995732307434082], [3.912022829055786, 1.622698148091634, 4.605170185988091, 1.7484991891043526, 1.0498220920562744, 0.13926206529140472, 2.6584523200988768, 2.4290894359350204, 3.912022829055786, 0.04082195460796356], [1.8971199989318848, 1.8971199989318848, 3.0411155777318135, 0.7832902584757123, 0.3285040259361267, 0.06187540665268898, 4.092180395126343, 3.71663998067379, 1.8971199989318848, 0.0], [2.813410758972168, 1.413370172182719, 4.605170185988091, 1.0796901413372584, 1.469675898551941, 0.07257062196731567, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 0.030459178611636162], [3.242592351485517, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 1.807507826196194, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 0.16528009093910292, 3.9357395320454622], [3.4657359027997265, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 2.772588722239781, 4.1588830833596715, 4.605170185988091, 4.1588830833596715, 0.38612214526503347, 1.807507826196194]], "target_roberta_idx": [74, 75, 122, 128, 144, 146, 155, 156, 164, 167], "target_prob_idx": [72, 73, 119, 125, 141, 143, 152, 153, 161, 164]}

The larvae then undergoes a series of physical changes and migrations, eventually transforming into a smolt, which is a young salmon that is ready to migrate to the ocean. In the ocean, the smolt grows and matures into an adult salmon, which can live for several years before returning to fresh water to spawn and complete its life cycle. The adult salmon then dies after spawning, and the cycle begins again with the next generation of eggs. One of the main features of the life cycle of a salmon is the migration from fresh water to salt water and back again.

{"text": "The diagram illustrates the various stages in the life cycle of a salmon, starting from the egg and culminating in the adult fish. The life cycle begins with the salmon eggs being laid in a gravel bed by the female fish. These eggs then hatch after a period of roughly three months, resulting in alevins. The alevins remain in the gravel bed where they feed on their yolk sacs until they are fully absorbed. At this point, they emerge as fry. Once the fry have hatched, they venture out into the open water and begin their journey downstream. During this stage, they are highly susceptible to predators and face significant risks. However, those that survive continue to grow and develop, gradually transforming into parr. Over time, the parr undergo significant physical changes. They develop distinct markings on their bodies, including vertical bars, which help them blend in with their surroundings.", "label": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "label_int": 6, "est_prob_list": [[4.605170185988091, 3.912022829055786, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 3.912022829055786, 3.912022829055786, 4.605170185988091], [2.970078627268473, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 2.893551971231188, 3.5065579414367676, 3.5065579414367676, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 3.58602108558019], [0.8439700603485107, 0.08338159322738647, 2.411494936261858, 0.019383113661950283, 3.383265631539481, 1.6607311964035034, 0.08283119542258126, 0.6942137386649847, 1.56064772605896, 1.141448716322581], [1.6607311964035034, 0.13926206529140472, 0.34470221400260925, 1.404629490592263, 4.605170185988091, 0.23572230339050293, 0.6812083316700799, 1.4035762250423431, 1.56064772605896, 0.7695303522050381], [0.4004775285720825, 0.3011050820350647, 1.570784057889666, 0.5370718565854159, 4.605170185988091, 2.207274913787842, 0.16737982950040273, 0.789099670946598, 1.3862943649291992, 1.0904943297306697], [0.33569129163814154, 0.08559193033540351, 0.8538295622504187, 4.605170185988091, 2.545455884111719, 0.4575811092471784, 1.175729592012541, 4.446565155811453, 1.175729592012541, 0.48258241145259567], [0.39768296766610944, 0.38612214526503347, 0.6325225587435105, 1.6739764335716716, 3.0602707946915624, 1.1631508098056809, 3.4657359027997265, 1.2966822024302034, 0.8446970786871463, 0.6776429940239801]], "target_roberta_idx": [41, 73, 112, 122, 134, 151, 153, 167, 168, 177], "target_prob_idx": [40, 68, 105, 115, 127, 143, 144, 158, 159, 168]}

However, the group warned that there was still uncertainty over whether or not it would be able to meet targets set out under new European Union rules on emissions testing. In January, Brussels announced plans to introduce tougher standards on diesel engines used in cars sold across Europe. This will mean manufacturers must cut nitrogen oxide (NOx) levels by 95%, which is expected to lead to increased costs.

{"text": "The answer is that the skin has a lot of oil. The more you use your razor, the more oils it will have on it and this can cause irritation to the skin. This is why shaving with a safety razor (or any other type) is so important. It's also why using an electric shaver or a cartridge razor is not recommended as they are too close to the skin for comfort. How do I know if my skin is irritated by shaving? If you feel like your face is burning when you shave, then there is probably something wrong with your skin. You should see your doctor immediately. If you don't see any improvement after a few days, then you may need to see a dermatologist. What causes razor burn? Razor burn happens because the skin is being exposed to too much friction from the blade. When you shave, the skin is constantly rubbing against the blades. As a result, the skin becomes dry and irritated. Is there anything else I can do about razor burn?

{"text": "It happens because of the friction between your skin and the blade. The blades are made from a very hard material, usually steel or stainless steel. When you shave with them they cut into your skin causing it to bleed. This is why shaving cream helps prevent this problem. Shaving without using any type of lubricant will cause more irritation than normal as well. If you have sensitive skin then you may want to use an aftershave lotion that has aloe vera in it. Aloe vera soothes irritated areas while also helping heal wounds. You can find these at most drug stores. A: It's not just \"razor burn\", but rather ingrown hairs (also known as folliculitis).

{"text": "Razor burn, also known as razor rash, is a common condition that occurs when shaving causes irritation, inflammation, or ingrown hairs. It can happen to anyone, regardless of their skin type or razor choice. Here are some reasons why razor burn might occur: 1. Ingrown hairs: When the hair follicle becomes trapped under the skin, it can cause inflammation and redness, leading to razor burn. This is more likely to happen if you have curly or coarse hair, or if you don't change your razor blade frequently. 2. Dull or rough skin: If your skin is dry, calloused, or has a buildup of dead skin cells, it can cause the razor to drag and cause irritation. Exfoliating your skin before shaving can help prevent this. 3. Improper shaving technique: Shaving too closely or applying too much pressure can cause razor burn. Take your time when shaving and use light, gentle strokes. 4. Sensitive skin: Some people may be more prone to razor burn due to sensitive skin.", "label": "Llama-2-13b-chat-hf", "label_int": 3, "est_prob_list": [[4.605170185988091, 3.726280403137207, 3.464413744211197, 4.0491959026881625, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 3.2188758850097656, 3.9120230674743652, 3.9169107526540756], [4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 2.1186592238289967, 1.3862942457199097, 1.3862942457199097, 1.3862942457199097, 2.1202635765075684, 3.2188758850097656, 4.004760339856148], [0.19109135959297419, 0.0174485413675441, 0.0, 0.1588614097226393, 1.9610366970300674, 0.9240625788692222, 0.0, 0.0064962160302971675, 0.0, 0.0], [1.724018633365631, 0.17435334622859955, 1.6607311964035034, 0.19126588531902858, 0.08486062195152044, 3.5065579414367676, 0.010050326585769653, 0.41558731347322464, 0.005025163292884827, 0.010050326585769653], [0.3267916639645894, 0.02020268701016903, 0.010050326585769653, 0.4097449779510498, 0.03564056660979986, 3.2188758850097656, 0.0, 0.14945924282073975, 0.0, 0.010050326585769653], [4.605170185988091, 1.9075912847531766, 3.347952867143343, 1.9075912847531766, 0.07290677080808779, 1.1884686177899708, 0.9007865453381898, 2.2493405784752336, 0.1980699137620938, 3.347952867143343], [4.605170185988091, 3.242592351485517, 2.772588722239781, 1.3862943611198906, 0.4093790074293007, 1.4180430594344708, 0.29815337231907635, 1.3555227024531369, 0.3087354816496133, 2.5494451709255714]], "target_roberta_idx": [31, 49, 51, 79, 88, 89, 90, 118, 125, 148], "target_prob_idx": [28, 46, 48, 73, 82, 83, 84, 112, 118, 139]}

{"text": "Razor burn happens when the skin is irritated by the sharp blade of a razor. It can also be caused by using a dull razor, shaving with too much pressure, or shaving too close to the skin. The irritation causes the skin to become red, itchy, and sometimes burns. The burning sensation can last up to 24 hours, and can be more intense if shaving cream or soap is used.  To prevent razor burn, it is important to ensure the razor is always sharp. This can be done by honing the blade after each use, or by using a disposable razor. Pressure should also be avoided when shaving, and the skin should be shaved in the direction of the hair growth. A lubricating gel or cream should also be used to reduce irritation. If razor burn does occur, applying a cool compress can help reduce the redness and itching.", "label": "alpaca-7b", "label_int": 5, "est_prob_list": [[3.6039575470818415, 3.9120230674743652, 3.9120230674743652, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 3.1885635256767273, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 2.995732307434082], [3.1390272511376276, 2.3025848865509033, 2.3025848865509033, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 2.957251787185669, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 3.573386639356613, 1.56064772605896], [0.008933623631795248, 0.0, 0.010050326585769653, 0.010050326585769653, 0.005025163292884827, 4.605170185988091, 1.6094379425048828, 0.04573356509208679, 2.0354433432221413, 0.6273148562759161], [0.006416464949584679, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.004232180972979071, 0.6133191474190459, 0.7339691519737244, 0.03909071422767343, 0.36363064370150466, 0.5052393825141553], [0.008933623631795248, 0.0, 0.010050326585769653, 0.010050326585769653, 0.005025163292884827, 4.605170185988091, 1.0788096189498901, 0.06659518033266068, 4.605170185988091, 0.7330325603485107], [2.2870809064580806, 0.12907704227514236, 3.0602707946915624, 1.1884686177899708, 1.0453677741492975, 0.8446970786871463, 0.26706278524904525, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 1.3555227024531369], [1.0453677741492975, 0.1158318155251217, 0.9602099658089905, 3.242592351485517, 0.9400072584914712, 2.1439800628174073, 0.2369097470783577, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 0.7411563997463059]], "target_roberta_idx": [56, 67, 69, 70, 71, 102, 115, 116, 119, 146], "target_prob_idx": [53, 64, 66, 67, 68, 98, 110, 111, 114, 140]}
{"text": "Razor burn is a common skin condition that occurs after shaving. It is characterized by redness, irritation, and a rash-like appearance on the skin. Razor burn can happen for several reasons. Firstly, inadequate lubrication is a common cause of razor burn. When the skin is not properly lubricated, the razor blade can cause friction and irritation, leading to razor burn. Using a shaving cream, gel, or foam can help create a smooth surface and reduce friction. Secondly, using a dull or old razor blade can contribute to razor burn. A dull blade requires more pressure to shave, which increases the risk of irritation and cuts. It is recommended to replace razor blades regularly to ensure a clean and smooth shave. Additionally, shaving against the grain of hair growth is another common cause of razor burn. Shaving in the opposite direction of hair growth can result in more resistance and irritation. It is advised to shave in the direction of hair growth to minimize the risk of razor burn. Sensitive skin can also be a factor in razor burn.", "label": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "label_int": 6, "est_prob_list": [[3.2188757260640464, 4.605170185988091, 2.995732069015503, 2.995732069015503, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091], [4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 3.912022829055786, 2.207274913787842, 2.525728464126587, 2.946417713165283, 2.449729251861572, 1.7023058107921056, 1.8679075717926026, 2.4079456329345703], [0.1053604781627655, 0.0, 0.06187540665268898, 0.26136478781700134, 1.6094379425048828, 0.24404306709766388, 1.864497122168541, 2.7143897329057967, 0.34569845348596573, 0.18632960319519043], [0.6733445525169373, 0.02020268701016903, 1.1711829900741577, 0.26136478781700134, 0.6733444333076477, 0.07309124805033207, 4.605170185988091, 1.6611147778374808, 0.19213342368602754, 0.5108255743980408], [0.4942963123321533, 0.04082195460796356, 0.4307829439640045, 0.051293306052684784, 0.37106359004974365, 0.148866206407547, 3.2236191749572756, 1.0800716366086687, 0.15810970067977906, 0.4462871253490448], [0.09413899091386191, 0.001991048962765894, 0.039845908547199674, 0.26197371574157396, 0.2542939852306962, 2.1778816144930886, 4.605170185988091, 0.8392581439097335, 0.18167253638915243, 1.3256697393034558], [0.13353139262452263, 4.605170185988091, 0.2876820724517809, 1.4508328822574619, 1.067840630001356, 1.6739764335716716, 4.605170185988091, 3.0602707946915624, 0.5753641449035618, 1.3555227024531369]], "target_roberta_idx": [30, 46, 52, 78, 117, 125, 175, 181, 183, 192], "target_prob_idx": [25, 40, 46, 71, 110, 118, 167, 173, 175, 184]}

Ingredients in shaving creams or gels can also contribute to skin sensitivity and cause razor burn. 3. **Shaving Technique:** Shaving against the grain (opposite the direction of hair growth) can increase the risk of irritation, ingrown hairs, and razor burn. Improper technique such as not using smooth, even strokes can also contribute to skin irritation. 4. **Lack of Lubrication:** Shaving without sufficient lubrication (such as water, soap, or shaving cream) can increase the risk of razor burn because the razor does not glide smoothly over the skin. 5.", "label": "gpt-4-1106-preview", "label_int": 7, "est_prob_list": [[4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 3.808832698398166, 4.605170185988091, 4.5246428142894395, 4.605170185988091], [3.406877326965332, 3.401530921459198, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 3.3786992496914334, 2.830813029408455, 4.508436484770342, 4.006030195951462], [0.7013115882873535, 4.605170185988091, 0.1571482022603353, 1.1512925624847412, 1.065156951546669, 0.010050326585769653, 0.1892137277043528, 0.03712524399161339, 0.38362275470386853, 0.0], [2.066705274581909, 4.605170185988091, 0.4107906421025594, 0.78032386302948, 1.7583041340112686, 0.010050326585769653, 0.8026982678307427, 0.14143338203430175, 2.0969138687307183, 0.008164403587579727], [2.049500325322151, 4.605170185988091, 1.1813045342763264, 0.6546666622161865, 1.9712410038337111, 0.030459178611636162, 0.6099231257620785, 0.006030195951461792, 0.23219344290820035, 0.004040537402033806], [1.7609878105613013, 1.807507826196194, 0.8817383503674954, 0.36902771190573336, 1.3862943611198906, 2.906120114864304, 0.2124586512141934, 0.04391923393483549, 4.446565155811453, 3.9357395320454622], [1.5198257537444133, 1.6918814048466833, 0.9602099658089905, 0.42121346507630353, 1.0745586061964725, 0.007362007967667141, 0.23083401790756208, 0.021402430625683394, 4.605170185988091, 3.4657359027997265]], "target_roberta_idx": [43, 44, 50, 51, 77, 78, 121, 135, 174, 196], "target_prob_idx": [42, 43, 49, 50, 73, 74, 114, 127, 163, 184]}

A: I think that this question has been answered in a previous post, but I'll try and give you my take on why people are generally monogamous (and not polygamous). The reason for being monogamous is because there is no benefit from having more than one sexual partner at any given time. If we assume that all humans were born with an equal capacity to reproduce then if two individuals had multiple partners they would be able to produce offspring much faster than those who did not.

{"text": "Most of society is monogamous due to a combination of biological, social, and cultural influences. Monogamy refers to the practice of having a single long-term partner or spouse at a time, and it has been the predominant form of relationship in many societies. From a biological standpoint, monogamy can be attributed to several factors. One of the primary reasons is the need for parental investment in offspring. Humans have relatively long childhoods, and raising a child requires significant time, effort, and resources. Monogamy provides a stable environment for child-rearing, ensuring that both parents are involved in providing care and support.", "label": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "label_int": 6, "est_prob_list": [[3.9120230674743652, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 3.9120230674743652, 3.9120230674743652, 3.9120230674743652, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091], [4.605170185988091, 2.4079456329345703, 2.4079456329345703, 2.9281471371650696, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.005696356296539, 2.856916308403015, 2.5111359357833862], [0.04082195460796356, 0.06391669064760208, 0.12783338129520416, 2.16083220243454, 2.4079456329345703, 2.4079456329345703, 2.4079456329345703, 0.02020268701016903, 3.2188756465911865, 0.02020268701016903], [0.030459178611636162, 0.16425201296806335, 0.3285040259361267, 2.2045405209064484, 0.4620353579521179, 0.4620353579521179, 0.4620353579521179, 0.02020268701016903, 4.605170185988091, 0.2231435328722], [0.10536054521799088, 0.0992254763841629, 0.1984509527683258, 1.4853226274251938, 1.2729655504226685, 1.2729655504226685, 1.2729655504226685, 0.0, 3.9120230674743652, 0.051293306052684784], [0.0442922749308752, 0.044035759957375395, 0.7744928200138977, 4.1588830833596715, 0.3956312428168854, 0.39925731385717106, 2.018816919863401, 0.00288159903660883, 1.3083428106148867, 0.023812254668266395], [0.1070981355563671, 0.6776429940239801, 0.6473376445286511, 4.1588830833596715, 1.067840630001356, 1.7609878105613013, 3.7534179752515073, 2.772588722239781, 1.556193397915288, 0.2173012756899814]], "target_roberta_idx": [24, 37, 38, 63, 73, 74, 75, 95, 97, 100], "target_prob_idx": [20, 31, 32, 56, 66, 67, 68, 87, 89, 92]}

{"text": "Refrigerants, such as freon, work by using a cycle of evaporation and condensation to transfer heat from one location to another. The process begins when a liquid refrigerant is pumped into the evaporator coil, which is located in the freezer or refrigerator. As warm air from the inside of the appliance passes over the coil, it causes the liquid refrigerant to evaporate into a gas. This process absorbs heat from the air, cooling it down. The now-cooled gas refrigerant then passes through a compressor, which compresses it and raises its temperature.

If contesting and calling attention to oneself is the norm, then rethinking what is descendingly important in your tasks becomes the norm as a first step - do the things that doing so are not a pleasure, comes first.

Normally, gravity will pull objects in close together, until stronger electromagnetic forces balance it out, and establish a stable distance. The theory of black holes is that if you just keep adding/compacting mass, eventually you get so much of it so close together that it overwhelms every other force, and just keeps getting closer and closer together, which in turn makes the force stronger and stronger (because it degrades with distance.)

{"text": "The answer is that the black hole has an infinite volume, and so it's not really a \"massless\" object. The reason for this is that if you take any point in space (say, the center of a sphere) and then move it to another location, you will find that your new position is still in the same place as before. This means that there are no points on the surface of the sphere where you could be moving away from the center without being displaced by some distance.

{"text": "The concept of a black hole having infinite density but finite mass is a paradox. This paradox is due to the fact that the mass of a black hole is determined by its event horizon, which is the point at which no light can escape its pull. The density of a black hole is determined by its singularity, which is an infinitely small point with an infinite density. Due to this, the mass and density of a black hole are mutually exclusive. The explanation for this paradox lies in the concept of a singularity. A singularity is an object with a gravitational pull so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape its grasp. As the mass of a black hole increases, its event horizon expands, meaning more matter can be pulled in, increasing the mass of the black hole. However, the singularity at the centre of the black hole remains the same, meaning its density remains infinite.", "label": "alpaca-7b", "label_int": 5, "est_prob_list": [[3.912022829055786, 3.912022829055786, 4.605170185988091, 3.9120230674743652, 3.9120230674743652, 4.1100651025772095, 3.5723825097084045, 3.912022829055786, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091], [3.912022829055786, 3.912022829055786, 3.5065579414367676, 2.3025851249694824, 2.3025851249694824, 4.605170185988091, 2.4850813671946526, 3.912022829055786, 4.605170185988091, 4.143072128295898], [0.030459178611636162, 0.030459178611636162, 0.8371766606966654, 0.004040537402033806, 0.11653383076190948, 3.3132306337356567, 2.0402207374572754, 0.28768208622932434, 0.1984509527683258, 0.7697759512811899], [0.026189955167896226, 0.022150444430201408, 0.2284161001443863, 0.0029201666512945826, 0.09431064873933792, 0.2534717147167259, 2.813410758972168, 0.3285040259361267, 0.04609813555731613, 1.3843375444412231], [0.4307829439640045, 0.4307829439640045, 0.685241644581159, 0.010258648544549942, 0.16251890361309052, 4.605170185988091, 1.8971199989318848, 0.23572230339050293, 0.051293306052684784, 0.9151468053460121], [1.0453677741492975, 0.8356472431672284, 0.3522205935893521, 0.27731928541623435, 0.7168637071772613, 1.4180430594344708, 4.605170185988091, 0.01178795575204224, 0.3466804132137367, 2.7119641004233466], [1.8562979903656263, 1.2685113254635072, 1.5198257537444133, 2.2129729343043585, 1.3862943611198906, 0.33024168687057687, 4.605170185988091, 0.039845908547199674, 0.7744928200138977, 2.6548056865833978]], "target_roberta_idx": [39, 40, 60, 64, 65, 73, 88, 121, 138, 176], "target_prob_idx": [38, 39, 59, 62, 63, 71, 86, 117, 134, 171]}
{"text": "A black hole is a region in space where gravity is so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape its pull. One of the most intriguing aspects of black holes is their infinitely dense nature. When a massive star collapses under its own gravity, it forms a singularity at the center, which is a point of infinite density and zero volume. However, it is important to note that this singularity is a theoretical concept, and our current understanding of physics breaks down in such extreme conditions. Therefore, we cannot precisely describe what happens at the singularity. The concept of infinite density arises because, as matter collapses to an infinitesimally small point, the mass remains constant. Density is defined as mass divided by volume, and as the volume approaches zero, the density approaches infinity. This is why we say that black holes have infinite density. However, it is essential to understand that the mass of a black hole is still finite. The event horizon, which is the boundary beyond which nothing can escape, is a sphere with a finite surface area.", "label": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "label_int": 6, "est_prob_list": [[4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.258596658706665, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 3.9120230674743652, 3.9120230674743652, 3.9120230674743652], [4.105881532033284, 3.4651927947998047, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 2.813410758972168, 2.813410758972168, 2.813410758972168], [1.3862942457199097, 0.6228994822336568, 0.0491942364190306, 0.02020268701016903, 0.9054921939969063, 1.2039728164672852, 0.16251890361309052, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091], [1.3093332052230835, 0.6315133207374148, 0.1975675012384142, 0.15082280337810516, 1.0397207736968994, 1.3862943649291992, 1.0216511487960815, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091], [1.7719568014144897, 0.8134327630201975, 0.06509325121130262, 0.04082195460796356, 1.010305255651474, 1.3470736742019653, 0.26136478781700134, 4.605170185988091, 2.995732069015503, 2.995732069015503], [0.6068135220176439, 2.772588722239781, 4.605170185988091, 4.446565155811453, 0.5808130715667744, 0.8664485582490837, 0.08121513186578061, 1.3707901745839253, 4.605170185988091, 0.7915872533731978], [2.5494451709255714, 1.7165360479904674, 4.605170185988091, 4.605170185988091, 1.6331544390514163, 2.906120114864304, 1.807507826196194, 1.6739764335716716, 4.605170185988091, 0.5893503868783018]], "target_roberta_idx": [122, 123, 139, 141, 161, 162, 163, 181, 182, 183], "target_prob_idx": [119, 120, 132, 133, 153, 154, 155, 173, 174, 175]}
{"text": "A black hole is often described as having \"infinite density\" because its mass is concentrated into an infinitely small space at its center, known as the singularity. The density of an object is defined as its mass divided by its volume. As the volume approaches zero at the singularity, the density theoretically becomes infinite. However, it's crucial to recognize that this description of infinite density is a result of classical general relativity and breaks down under these extreme conditions. Our current understanding of physics, especially general relativity, cannot fully describe what happens within the singularity of a black hole. That's because general relativity - the theory that predicts the existence of black holes - does not incorporate quantum mechanics. At the very small scales where the singularity lies, quantum effects are expected to be significant, and a theory of quantum gravity would be needed to provide a complete description.
